## Upgrading the prototype kit

Based on https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/updating-the-kit

Add upstream to remotes:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit.git
```

Merge upstream to a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b upgrade-kit
git fetch upstream latest-release
git checkout upgrade-kit && git merge FETCH_HEAD --allow-unrelated-histories
```

Youâ€™ll get a few merge conflicts where both apps are trying to add the same files.

When merging the upgrade, do a squash and merge to avoid adding 1500 new commits to the timeline.
