# Find postgraduate teacher training (prototype)

This prototype is based on the [GOV.UK prototype kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit)

## Requirements

* Node.js - version 10.x.x

## Installation

* Clone this repository to a folder on your computer
* Open Terminal
* In Terminal, change the path to the repository
* Type `npm install` to install the dependencies

## Working locally

* In Terminal, change the path to the repository
* Type `npm start`  and start the application

## Updating prototype data

* In Terminal, change the path to the `generate-data` directory
* Type `bundle install` to install the Ruby dependencies
* Type `./generate.rb`. This will generate a new `courses.json` file in the `/app/data` directory

Before a new set of courses can be generated, the following files need to be present in the `generate-data` directory:

* **`courses-clean.json`**: Download [courses-clean.zip](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/search-and-compare-data/blob/master/courses-clean.zip) from the search-and-compare-data repo and add the extracted file
* **`course-enrichment.csv`**
* **`institution-enrichment.csv`**

## Upgrading the prototype kit

Based on https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/updating-the-kit

Add upstream to remotes:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit.git
```

Merge upstream to a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b upgrade-kit
git fetch upstream latest-release
git checkout upgrade-kit && git merge FETCH_HEAD --allow-unrelated-histories
```

Youâ€™ll get a few merge conflicts where both apps are trying to add the same files.

When merging the upgrade, do a squash and merge to avoid adding 1500 new commits to the timeline.
