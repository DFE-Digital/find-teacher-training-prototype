## Live service

The live service lives at:<br />
* http://find-postgraduate-teacher-training.education.gov.uk/
* https://github.com/DFE-Digital/search-and-compare-ui

Sometimes the original repository is branched and hosted on Heroku to provide a prototype as close to what’s released as possible for accurate user research and experimentation.

These branches are hosted at:<br />
