        As a trainee primary teacher you’ll learn to teach all subjects across the national curriculum.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Some courses also enable you to develop your knowledge of a particular subject. When you’re a teacher, you could take on a role to influence the way it’s taught in your school - for example, mentoring your teacher colleagues to teach that subject better.
