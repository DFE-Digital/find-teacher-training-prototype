      <!-- <p>You can train to teach a subject even if you don’t have a degree in it, or if you haven’t used your degree knowledge recently. For some subjects you can take a subject knowledge enhancement (SKE) course.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Get financial support</h2>
      <p>Most courses charge a fee. You can get financial support to help with the costs of your course. The financial support options available to you will depend on the subject you choose.</p>
      <!-- <p>For some subjects you could be eligible for up to £28,000 tax-free while you train, through a bursary or scholarship.</p> -->
      <!-- <p>Most subjects have a few courses that pay a salary. These usually have no fees and you’ll be paid and taxed as an unqualified teacher with salaries starting from £16,000.</p> -->
      <!-- <p>Student finance (tuition fee and maintenance loans) is available for all subjects.</p> -->
