          To get onto a training course you’ll need the following qualifications, or the international equivalent:
        </p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>grade C or above GCSEs in maths and English, plus a science subject if you want to teach in a primary school</li>
          <li>a British degree</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In most cases you’ll also need <a href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/school-experience"> school experience</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          If English isn't your first language you'll need to pass the IELTS exam with a score of 6.5 or higher, or an equivalent qualification.
