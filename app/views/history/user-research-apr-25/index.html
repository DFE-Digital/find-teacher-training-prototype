    <p>Users had a better understanding of how to use this field.</p>
    <p>The private beta data highlighted a new problem with this autocomplete: If we don’t have course data for the provider a user searches for, the user sees a confusing error. (In this case the provider was the well known ‘Goldsmiths’)</p>
    <p>By using school in the label we risk users searching for schools that are not ‘lead-schools’ – we haven’t seen this as a problem in research yet.</p>

    <p>When launching private beta we will not have every business studies course. Trial a banner to indicate this and to point to where users can continue their search.</p>

    <p>We iterated this design to create a <a href="/history/private-beta-launch#disclaimer">full-page disclaimer</a> in the search flow.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>In the private beta all courses are for business studies. Having the subject as the search result title <a href="/history/user-research-apr-12#search-results">made it difficult to differentiate between results</a>.</p>

    <p>In this round we updated the title to include both subject and course provider.</p>

    <p>With private beta data and a limited number of courses we found users often filtered themselves into a no results view (<a href="https://dfedigital.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=2&projectKey=BATSA&modal=detail&selectedIssue=BATSA-217">BATSA-217</a>).</p>

    <p>In this round we trialled a ‘suggested searches’ view. We wanted to indicate to users that their search was too constrained and that more results were available.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Result</h3>
    <p>Users saw and interacted with these links, but this didn’t prevent an initial misconception about the number of courses available to them. The design helps users find more courses but more work is needed to avoid this situation altogether.</p>
