  <p class="govuk-body">You’ll  need the right to study in the UK. You already have this if, for example, you:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>are an Irish citizen</li>
    <li>have settled or pre-settled status under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families">EU Settlement Scheme</a> (you may still be able to apply)</li>
    <li>have indefinite leave to remain in the UK</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">If you do not already have the right to study in the UK, you may need to apply for a visa. The main visa for fee-paying courses (those that you have to pay for) is the Student visa.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">To apply for a Student visa, you’ll need to be sponsored by your training provider.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Sponsorship is not available for this course.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">If you need a visa, filter your course search to find courses with visa sponsorship.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">Alternatively, check if you’re eligible for a different type of visa, such as a Graduate or Family visa, that allows you to train to be a teacher without being sponsored.</p>
