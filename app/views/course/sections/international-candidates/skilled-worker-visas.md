If you do not already have the right to work in the UK for the duration of this course, you may need to apply for a [Skilled Worker visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa). To apply for a Skilled Worker visa you need to be sponsored by your employer.

We can sponsor a Skilled Worker visa and help you to apply.

You can also [learn more about different types of visa](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/train-to-teach-in-england-non-uk-applicants/train-to-teach-in-england-if-youre-a-non-uk-citizen#studying-and-working-as-a-teacher-in-the-uk-without-a-skilled-worker-visa-or-a-student-visa) which allow you to train to be a teacher without being sponsored.
