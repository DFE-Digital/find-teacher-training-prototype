If you do not already have the right to work in the UK, you may need to apply for a visa. The main visa for salaried courses is the [Skilled Worker visa](https://www.gov.uk/student-visa).

Sponsorship for a Skilled Worker visa is not available for this course.

If you need a visa, filter your course search to find courses with visa sponsorship.

You can also [learn more about different types of visa](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/train-to-teach-in-england-non-uk-applicants/train-to-teach-in-england-if-youre-a-non-uk-citizen#studying-and-working-as-a-teacher-in-the-uk-without-a-skilled-worker-visa-or-a-student-visa) which allow you to train to be a teacher without being sponsored.
