If you do not already have the right to work in the UK, you may need to apply for a visa. The main visa for salaried courses is the [Skilled Worker visa](https://www.gov.uk/student-visa).

Sponsorship for a Skilled Worker visa is not available for this course.

If you need a visa, filter your course search to find courses with visa sponsorship.
