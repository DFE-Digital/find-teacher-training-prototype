You could be eligible for a bursary of £{{ course.bursary_amount | numeral('0,0') }}.

To be eligible for a bursary you’ll need a 2:2 degree in any subject. You do not need to apply for a bursary. If you’re eligible, you’ll automatically start receiving it when you start the course.

You may also be eligible for a student loan. These are normally for undergraduate courses but you can also apply if you do postgraduate teacher training. [Find out how much loan you could get using the student finance calculator](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance-calculator).
