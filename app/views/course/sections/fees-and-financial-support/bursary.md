You’ll get a bursary of £{{ course.bursary_amount | numeral('0,0') }} if you have {{ course.bursary_first_line_ending if course.bursary_requirements.length > 1 else course.bursary_requirements[0] + "." }}

{% if course.bursary_requirements.length > 1 %}
{% for requirement in course.bursary_requirements %}
- {{ requirement }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

You do not have to apply for a bursary - if you’re eligible, you’ll automatically start receiving it once you begin your course.

You may be eligible for a [loan while you study](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/funding-my-teacher-training/tuition-fee-and-maintenance-loans).
