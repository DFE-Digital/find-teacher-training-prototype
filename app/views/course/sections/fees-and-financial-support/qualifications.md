#### Refreshing your subject knowledge

If you have the right qualities and qualifications to teach but need to refresh your subject knowledge, you might be asked to complete a [subject knowledge enhancement (SKE) course](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/explore-my-options/teacher-training-routes/subject-knowledge-enhancement-ske-courses).

You'll find out if you need to complete an SKE course after the interview stage.
