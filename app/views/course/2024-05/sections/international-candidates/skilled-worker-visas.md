If you do not already have the right to work in the UK for the duration of this course, you may need to apply for a [Skilled Worker visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa). To apply for a Skilled Worker visa you need to be sponsored by your employer.

We can sponsor a Skilled Worker visa and help you to apply.
