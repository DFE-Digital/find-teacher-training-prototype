      <!-- Dear [name] -->

      <p>We’re sorry to tell you that [Training Provider] have not been able to offer you a place to study [Course name (X100)].</p>

      <p>The reason they’ve given is as follows:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>candidate has potential but isn’t yet ready for teacher training</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can contact the training provider direct to get more details about their reasons for not offering you a place.</p>
      <p>Rejection by this provider does not mean that you won’t be accepted on to another training course this year or in the future. Many candidates apply successfully after an initial rejection because their second choice of provider turns out to be a ‘better fit’.</p>
      <p>You can search for and compare alternative training providers at <a href="/">Find postgraduate teacher training</a>.</p>
      <p>If you haven’t already done so, we suggest you register with Get into Teaching to get one-to-one support over the phone and email from advisors who are former teachers. They can help you choose a course that’s appropriate for you, fill gaps in your eligibility requirements, and gain experience to strengthen your application</p>
