      <!-- <p>Thank you for choosing to apply for teacher training through the Department for Education’s new application service.</p> -->

      <p>This is a new GOV.UK service being trialled with a small number of training providers, including the one you have selected.</p>
      <p>If in the future you decide to apply to providers who haven’t opted in to the trial, you will need to go through UCAS. Using the new service doesn’t stop you applying on UCAS for these other courses.</p>

      <p>You can use Apply for postgraduate teacher training to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>apply to your chosen course and other providers who have opted in to the trial</li>
        <li>get support from the Department for Education (DfE) when you apply</li>
        <li>tailor your application to suit different providers</li>
        <li>be enrolled in the same way as any other candidate, if you're successful</li>
        <li>get help if you need to apply to non-opted in providers using UCAS</li>
      </ul>
