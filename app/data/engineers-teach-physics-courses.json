The course will utilise the fantastic practical experience and knowledge that engineers have, which can help to make physics teaching come alive.  If you are an engineer who has interest in all aspects of science, but in particular physical sciences associated with forces, energy, mechanics, electrical effects, and enjoy investigating them in a practical setting, then this course will suit you.\r\n\r\nOur Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) in Secondary Education provides a high standard of training for those preparing to take up a teaching post in the secondary school sector. The course complies with statutory guidance from the Department for Education for Initial Teacher Training courses, covering the 5 core areas of the ITT Core Content Framework of behaviour management, pedagogy, curriculum, assessment and professional behaviours. \r\n\r\nThe PGCE in Secondary Education is specifically designed to ensure that those who are successful will be recommended for the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) - the professional award required by those who wish to teach in a maintained school. \r\n\r\nEngineering applies mathematics and areas of science to solve real world problems in different contexts. Whether you are a career changer, or recently graduated having studied engineering, this course will prepare and develop you to become ready for teaching. With your subject knowledge and commercial experience, engineers will be able to present contexts that will engage and enthuse students. Transferable skills which you will have developed in an engineering background, will give you a strong position to progress your career within a school environment into positions of responsibility.  \r\n\r\nOur course looks at  key ideas which underpin the teaching of physics in schools and the way children's understanding of concepts develops. As a trainee you will learn how to teach physics to pupils in the 11-16 age range within the secondary age phase, with additional primary and post-16 enhancements. You will learn how to develop skills, knowledge, and understanding for teaching physics through a combination of university-led and school-led training. \r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of the course will lead to recommendation for the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), along with 60 credits at Master’s level.
