    "AboutCourse": "The Canons Park Teaching School Alliance work in collaboration with Hillingdon SCITT to offer Harrow Options, a part-time salaried School Direct training programme for a limited number of top graduates who wish to teach. Trainees spend approximately two days in school and one day at the Hillingdon SCITT each week during term time, however there is flexibility on this route.\\r\n\\r\nAll courses are run in Harrow and allow teachers to develop their leadership skills whilst training to teach.

Training will continue over two years, both in school and at the Hillingdon SCITT.  The course leads to the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). \\r\n\\r\nThere are three assessment points over the two years and trainees are assessed through a combination of lesson observations and an evidence bundle include lesson plans and evaluations. Trainees will benefit from a variety of support: from Hillingdon SCITT, from their mentor in school, from the Higher Level Teaching Assistant, from a Professional Mentor in school and from a Specialist Leader in Education who will ensure the coherence of the course.  Colleagues in all these roles are well trained and experienced.  We are committed to training creative, innovative and reflective practitioners who see themselves as future leaders.  \\r\n",
