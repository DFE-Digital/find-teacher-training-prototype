    "HowSchoolPlacementsWork": "Our partnership of over 150 schools is well-established and we have clear and strong working relationships with a range of primary schools across Suffolk and Norfolk and into Cambridgeshire. We go to great lengths through quality assurance and our local knowledge to ensure that all placements are of a high standard. Trainees are supported by school mentors who are enthusiastic, committed and well-trained individuals. \\r\nTrainees spend approximately 26 weeks on school placement. Most of this is in the main placement school, with half a term in the spring term in a contrasting school.\\r\nThe distance to school placements will vary. These take into account the trainee’s home address, whether they have their own transport and the placement that the school is able to offer. Our policy is to endeavour to keep journey times to school to a maximum of 50 minutes each way.\\r\n"
