    "AboutCourse": "This is a course for talented linguists who want to teach French and/or Spanish in schools. You should have a belief in the emancipatory power of languages, and how mastery over another language opens up other worlds – travel, literature, employment, culture – to those who learn them. People who are fascinated by other cultures see language as inseparable from the human experience. Linguists are utterly intrigued by the complexity of language, its properties, and the way in which meaning is enshrined within it. You will have an interest in the deeper structures of language shared across different languages, and what this reveals about the way we communicate with others as humans. Trainees who follow this course have an absolute commitment to communication in all its forms, including the spoken and written word. In a modern globalised world, the ability to speak a second or third language opens doors to employment across the globe. If you have this deep love of languages and you want to inspire a similar love in pupils, then this course is for you.\\r\n \\r\nIn this course you will learn about language acquisition and the way in which people learn additional languages. You will study common errors and misconceptions that pupils develop, and how these can be predicted, mitigated, and overcome. You will study the grammar of your language, and what it means to study and learn grammar in the context of learning to speak a language. You will learn about different curriculum models in languages, how these are structures, and how they are assessed, including at GCSE and A Level.\\r\n \\r\nOne of the most distinctive characteristics of Inspiration Teacher Training is the value it places on the richness of knowledge. Firstly, you will deepen your knowledge within your subject specialism, including of literature in your language. Secondly, you will develop professional knowledge to support your subject specialism. You will survey a range of educational research which will shape your teaching practice as you develop a better understanding about learning, reading and memory.",
