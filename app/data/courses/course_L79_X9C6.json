    "AboutCourse": "This Post Graduate Certificate Education (PGCE) Secondary Physical Education course leads to the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), qualifying you to teach the 11-18 age group in secondary schools in England and Wales.\\r\n\\r\nYou will be taught by staff with national and international reputations as experts in the field of physical education; these staff are supported by expert practitioners from local schools.\\r\n\\r\nOur excellent teaching facilities, including a sports hall and gymnasium with extensive resources and equipment, will provide the setting for your practical teaching.\\r\n\\r\nThe content of the programme is grounded in the evidence-based principles of teaching and learning. You will examine a range of pedagogical approaches to physical education teaching, including workshop-led and informal approaches to learning.

Sessions may include:\\r\n\\r\n* participating in workshop style sessions with your peers\\r\n* attending presentations by subject experts\\r\n* working on tasks in groups\\r\n* having individual tutorials\\r\n* visits to schools or other education settings\\r\n* visits to theatres, museums, galleries or sites of educational interest\\r\n* writing assignments on aspects of subject teaching and Professional Studies\\r\n\\r\nThese learning activities will help you to develop a toolkit of knowledge and skills, ensuring you are well prepared to tackle challenges and opportunities throughout your training and your career.\\r\n\\r\nAlongside the University tutors, you will be taught and guided by a team of committed and experienced University-trained school mentors.",

Placements also provide you with the opportunity to connect with potential employers and build your professional network.\\r\n\\r\nAt Secondary level we have strong relationships with around 80 schools in the local and surrounding area. It is a testament to the strength of these partnerships and the regard with which our graduates are held, that most schools in Berkshire employ at least one graduate of the Institute of Education.\\r\n\\r\nOn your Secondary PGCE course you are required to carry out three placements in two different age groups - ensuring you receive a broad range of experiences. Two placements must be undertaken in a school setting but the third can be taken in a different setting - allowing you to sample teaching in an alternative environment.\\r\n\\r\nWe offer our students an unusually flexible and broad range of settings and educational environments - you will have the opportunity to gain experience in special needs schools, Pupil Referral Units, independent schools, museums, and charities.\\r\n\\r\nYou will have plenty of opportunities throughout your course to apply your developing skills in real settings. In schools, you will be involved in:\\r\n\\r\n* observation of other teachers\\r\n* planning and teaching parts of lessons/small groups\\r\n* planning and teaching lessons and sequences of lessons\\r\n* reflecting on and evaluating your teaching\\r\n* receiving feedback on your teaching\\r\n* gaining experience of the range of responsibilities of classroom teachers."
