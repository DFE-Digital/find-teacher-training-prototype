We are passionate about inspiring change which transforms the lives of children and young people both in the UK and internationally.\\r\n\\r\nInitial teacher training (ITT) programmes received an Ofsted grade of 'Good' in November 2014. The Ofsted report comments on the strongly cohesive training programmes between the University and partner schools. Individual students are very well supported during their training and into their teaching posts. Trainees are well prepared to teach the primary/early years curriculum through the use of interactive face to face technology enhanced learning events as well as on line packages. These all address national ITT content criteria as well as focusing on behaviour management strategies.  There is a high level of employment for newly qualified teachers which demonstrates the value placed on the trainees in the Partnership of over 150 diverse schools and settings.\\r\n\\r\nAll students have access to purpose-built teaching and learning resources on the new Waterside Campus allowing them to develop their professional abilities. Facilities include fully equipped rooms; teaching and learning involves using technology, high quality teaching resources, workshops and group work relevant to the variety of educational settings in which students will be working.\\r\n\\r\n",
