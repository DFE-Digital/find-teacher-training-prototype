    "AboutCourse": "One of the features of our training that sets us aside from other providers is its bespoke nature.  Our training is designed by a highly qualified team of senior teachers and leading academics and is primarily based in school.  The training is regularly adjusted to meet your emerging needs and to respond to the ever changing education landscape ensuring that you are learning at the cutting edge of research and best practice. \\r\n\\r\nEvidence shows that the best learning comes from training alongside the highest quality teachers, and at Essex and Thames Primary SCITT, you benefit from a significant amount of real school experience as you work alongside the best teachers in our area. We offer two training centres in Essex (Wickford and Southend) and give you access to all Canterbury Christ Church University facilities.\\r\n\\r\nDuring the year you will spend around 70 days in centre-based training, learning and practising your craft before teaching in the classroom. This includes sessions in all national curriculum subjects and associated areas, plus dedicated sessions for professional studies, SEND and inclusion, children’s mental health, behaviour and voice. Your teaching will be assessed by school mentors and your tutors.\\r\n\\r\nIf you already know you wish to specialise in Special Educational Needs and Disability or in Early Years Foundation Stage, we offer placements in both areas enabling you to gain invaluable experience.

Anyone can apply for the school direct salaried route (the three year’s work experience has been removed as a requirement) but you should be aware that competition is fierce due to a smaller number of schools offering salaried places.  Several of our schools do, however, offer salaried places each year. All are keen to find high quality trainees and invest in your school direct training with the promise of a job in the school at the end of the training if an appropriate position becomes available. \\r\n",

If you already have a school that wants to employ you please let us know in your application.  If you apply to this route and do not then secure a school to offer you a school direct salaried position, we always offer the training route place as an alternative.\\r\n\\r\nSuccessful applicants will be notified within 2 working days and offered a place. \\r\n",
