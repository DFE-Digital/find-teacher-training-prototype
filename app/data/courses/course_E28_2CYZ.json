To complement this, our end of programme survey outcomes in July 2018, suggest that over 95% of our teacher trainees rate the quality of their training through UEL as good or higher. Employability is also excellent with most subjects, phases and routes achieving 95-100% employment each year. \\r\n\\r\nUEL is an inclusive university and our teacher training programmes are highly diverse and multicultural. We are very proud of our trainee teachers, new and old, and what they have gone on to achieve in our schools. We are especially proud of the community we serve and how we take people from the local community who then go back into this community to teach - over 70% of our trainees find jobs within our partner schools each year. \\r\n\\r\nWe look forward to welcoming you to UEL and the Cass School of Education and Communities.",
