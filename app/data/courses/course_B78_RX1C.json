    "AboutCourse": "This course leads to the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) for the 11-to-16 age range, which qualifies you to be a teacher in secondary schools in England and Wales. Where possible, we also give you the chance to gain experience in the 11-to-18 age range.\\r\n\\r\nIt is of the utmost importance that all young people get the chance to learn at least one language to a high standard.\\r\n\\r\nThat’s why schools will always need highly-skilled language teachers to help pupils develop valuable, lifelong skills – and why trainee language teachers can benefit from the highest range of training bursaries.\\r\n\\r\nThe three most commonly taught languages in east London schools are French, German and Spanish, followed by Italian, Russian, Mandarin, Japanese, Urdu and Bengali. \\r\n\\r\nYour teacher training will help you discover how to open young people’s eyes and ears up to the beauty of the language by exploring its uses in business, everyday life and culture.\\r\n",

    "InterviewProcess": "You will be interviewed at UEL by the ML ITT course tutor, and where possible, a practising teacher from one of our partner schools. The interview will involve two tests - one that focuses on your literacy expertise and one that considers you subject knowledge. These tests are not pass/ fail in design, but simply enable us to ascertain the best ways of supporting these areas as you hopefully progress onto the programme. You are also asked to prepare a lesson plan for Year 7 pupils, which you will present during the interview. ",

    "HowSchoolPlacementsWork": "We work within a very large partnership of schools across London and also Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent and Surrey. We do not wish to disadvantage our trainees by asking them to travel a long distance to their placement schools. Generally, we look at one hour door to door as being the maximum travel time expected. You will be teaching all year groups in the 11-16 age range but we do provide 16-18 experience as well in many school placements. You will experience two, twelve week placements in two complementary schools. You will be supported in these schools by a school based mentor as well as your UEL tutor. "

    "TrainWithUs": "Our Partnership offers subject-specialist training in 8 secondary subjects. We are currently rated ‘Outstanding’ by Ofsted and our programme was ranked in the Top 5 of the Good Teacher Training Guide 2017. As a designated 11-19 provider you are guaranteed training and direct experience of A level/BTEC teaching as part of your programme. We also offer comprehensive training in generic elements such as behaviour management, pastoral care and working with pupils with SEND.\\r\n\\r\nThroughout the year, you will be supported by a subject specialist university tutor, as well as dedicated mentors in Partnership schools. The support that we offer is highly praised by our student teachers, and in the last two years, 99% of student teachers rated the quality of their training with us as either good or very good.\\r\n\\r\nYou are also able to take advantage of being part of a research-intensive university which offers the opportunity to benefit from cutting edge research in areas such as neuroscience and education. As part of the University’s Green Apple Project, we encourage our student teachers to focus on ‘sustainable education’ for the future.\\r\n\\r\nTypically, over 50% of those qualifying with us choose to remain in the Bristol area and have successfully secured teaching posts within our partnership schools by the end of the PGCE year. Many of our student teachers progress quickly in their careers, taking on roles such as subject leader and head of year. A number have gone beyond this, joining senior leadership teams.",
    "TrainWithDisability": "We welcome applications from candidates with disabilities and other needs and, within the context of University of Bristol support structures, we make reasonable adjustments to ensure that the programme is accessible to all. When a specific need is declared, offer holders are assessed by the University’s Occupational Health department and recommended to liaise with our Disability Service to ensure a Learning Support Plan can be put in place.\\r\n\\r\nMany lectures are audio-recorded and are made available via our VLE. When possible, lecture slides and handouts are made available to the whole cohort at least 24 hours in advance of the session. All University buildings are accessible including ramp/lift access. In cases where student teachers are required to move around the University campus to attend lectures, provision is made to support them, as appropriate. The University works closely with placement schools to ensure that needs are met whilst on teaching practice. For example, a student teacher with hearing disabilities was placed in a school that could provide carpeted classrooms.\\r\n\\r\nThe University has a comprehensive support structure to support students with a wide range of medical conditions, including mental health. This includes support from the Personal Tutor, the Senior Tutor and Programme Director, Professional Services staff as well asdepartment-based Student Welfare Advisors. If appropriate, student teachers can be referred to the University’s specialist Counselling Service or Occupational Health team.
