There is also the opportunity to achieve a masters in your NQT year, taking forward an action research school direct module credit towards this qualification, through a successfully run school-based course in collaboration with UEL. \\r\nWe scrutinize the School Direct applications and place trainees in their partnership schools.

    "CourseLength": "OneYear",

    "InterviewProcess": "We encourage candidates to visit our school prior to the selection process consisting of the following:\\r\n\\r\n -The scrutiny of a lesson plan to teach a specified aspect of the curriculum.\\r\n\\r\n- The observation by a Head teacher of the applicant delivering a lesson to the agreed year group.\\r\n\\r\n-A formal interview\\r\n",
    "HowSchoolPlacementsWork": "This one-year primary course is based in one school for the majority of the year with a contrast setting placement. Candidates learn the art of teaching in the classroom for four days each week, guided by their mentors.  Each trainee is allocated a professional tutor who visits and supports the trainee on a regular basis. Host schools are able to offer insights into their successful practices and induct trainees in line with the best of current teaching.  Part of the course is theory based and there will be formal training each Thursday.  School Direct requires a full time commitment of 5 days per week from September to July and trainees are expected to participate fully in the everyday life of the schools in which they train."
