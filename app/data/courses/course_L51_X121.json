    "AboutCourse": "Our Post Graduate Certificate Education (PGCE) Primary - the Early Years pathway leads to the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) giving you the experience, the opportunity and the knowledge to work in both Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) settings and Infant/Primary school settings.\\r\n\\r\nThe EYFS is a unique phase of education which involves learning through play and first hand experiences both inside and outdoors. This phase leads into Key Stage 1, when children really start to engage with learning to read, applying their mathematical knowledge and making sense of how the world works.\\r\n\\r\nChoose the Early Years pathway if you are interested in early learning and early child development. In choosing this pathway you will experience both the EYFS and Key Stage 1 phases and therefore be highly skilled in two curricula. If you are interested in the rewards and challenges of being an Early Years expert teacher choose this pathway.\\r\n\\r\nTutors are internationally or nationally renowned and their research regularly has a direct impact on school curricula and learning techniques, both in the UK and abroad. As experts in their field, their research also directly informs the focus and content of your course.\\r\n\\r\nLearning takes place through a series of lectures,, practical seminars and workshops, where interactive and discussion-based techniques will encourage you to engage, reflect and challenge. Sessions may include:\\r\n\\r\n* participating in workshop style sessions with your peers\\r\n* attending presentations by subject experts\\r\n* working on tasks in groups\\r\n* having individual tutorials\\r\n* visits to schools or other education settings\\r\n* visits to theatres, museums, galleries or sites of educational interest\\r\n* writing assignments on aspects of subject teaching and Professional Studies\\r\n\\r\nAlongside the University tutors, you will be taught and guided by a team of committed and experienced University-trained school mentors.",
    "CourseLength": "OneYear",
    "Qualifications": "We would normally expect you to have a 1st, 2:1 or 2:2 honours degree (or equivalent from a university outside the UK) .  You will also need to have achieved  Grade 4 (or C) or above in GCSE Mathematics, English Language and a Science subject (or equivalent qualifications). \\r\n\\r\nYou will also be required to pass the QTS skills tests in numeracy and literacy.",

    "HowSchoolPlacementsWork": "Placements enable you to develop the skills and knowledge valued and desired by employers - you will build your confidence in the classroom and gain practical teaching experience. Placements also provide you with the opportunity to connect with potential employers and build your professional network.\\r\n\\r\nYou will have plenty of opportunities throughout your PGCE to apply your developing skills to real-life settings. We have strong partnerships with over 300 local schools and are renowned for our relationships with these partner schools.\\r\n\\r\nIt is a testament to the strength of our partnerships and the regard in which our graduates are held, that most schools in Berkshire employ at least one graduate of the Institute of Education."

    "TrainWithUs": "Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU) has a long established reputation for providing high quality Teacher Training, working in close Partnership with over 300 committed, welcoming and diverse schools across the North West. \\r\n\\r\nOur academic team is made up of successful teachers who maintain strong links with schools and professional bodies, ensuring you receive the most up-to-date training during your course. Our most recent OFSTED inspection acknowledged that: “all trainees are very well prepared to teach their chosen age range and specialist subject”. Employment rates are consistently above average for the sector.\\r\n\\r\nMost Teacher training courses offer a PGCE Award which is worth 60 credits at Masters Level. LJMU, is one of a small number of teacher training providers that offers a Post Graduate Diploma in Education and Qualified Teacher Status. This means that our beginning teachers graduate with 120 Masters level credits. Many  go on to complete a Masters in Education Practice during their early career.\\r\n\\r\nOur emphasis is on developing inclusive and reflective practitioners. Our courses ensure that LJMU teachers develop a deep understanding of the curriculum, learners and learning. This enables them to provide the very best and most appropriate learning opportunities for all children and young people, with a positive impact on all learners’ development and achievements. \\r\n\\r\nSchool-based experience takes place largely in a Home School, supported by  mentors. Shorter placements are also provided in contrasting school settings. This variety ensures that our students can confidently plan, teach and manage learning in different settings and socio-economic contexts.\\r\n",
    "TrainWithDisability": "LJMU is committed to Equality of Opportunity and proud of the help we offer. The Disability Advice Team will help you access the support you need. The best time to contact the Disability Advice Team is before you start your course. By contacting the team before you begin and disclosing your disability, you'll be able to receive support from when you arrive. Email: disability@ljmu.ac.uk Tel: 0151 231 3164/3165.\\r\n\\r\n If you need an Individual Student Learning Plan (ISLP) which sets out the type of support you may need and who is responsible for ensuring your support is in place, this will be put in place by an LJMU Disability Adviser once you have met to discuss your needs. Once finalised, your plan will be sent to you via email. As soon as you have agreed the ISLP it will be sent to your Disability Coordinator and then, with your agreement, passed on to the relevant academic and support staff.\\r\n\\r\nAll trainees are encouraged to disclose any specific learning need that they experience, in order to make any adjustments, both at LJMU and within our Partner Schools. As part of the enrolment process to Teacher Training Programmes all students are required to complete a Health Questionnaire and some may be asked to attend a screening appointment with our Occupational Health Unit. This is designed to ensure that arrangements are in place, from the outset, to support any students who may need additional support or reasonable adjustments to be made.\\r\n",
