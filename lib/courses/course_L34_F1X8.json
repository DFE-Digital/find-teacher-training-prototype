    "AboutCourse": "Student teachers within the Citizenship, Geography, RE and History subject specialisms are taught as a PGCE Humanities group. You will have specialist inputs on your chosen subject and also gain experience of issues in planning and teaching cross-curricular work within the Humanities. Your two school placements are in your specialist subjects.\\r\n\\r\nGeography is facing many challenges within the present education system. It is an exciting and relevant subject which plays a major role in helping children to develop a better understanding of the increasingly complex world around them.\\r\n\\r\nPGCE Secondary Geography aims to:\\r\n\\r\n•Broaden and deepen your knowledge and understanding of Geography for teaching purposes; \\r\n\\r\n•Provide you with an informed and critical view of National Curriculum, CSE, A level and relevant vocational requirements; \\r\n\\r\n•Raise awareness and provide experience of a broad range of learning and teaching strategies; \\r\n\\r\n•Develop your skills in classroom management, planning, communication, assessment, recording and evaluation; \\r\n\\r\n•Understand the differing needs of those with learning difficulties and very able students; and\\r\n\\r\n•Raise your awareness of a wide range of assessment strategies\\r\n\\r\nThe Geography subject specialism will run throughout the academic year and will cover a variety of areas including:\\r\n•Planning and curriculum in Geography\\r\n\\r\n•Approaches to student learning\\r\n\\r\n•Thinking skills\\r\n\\r\n•Enquiry based learning\\r\n\\r\n•Fieldwork\\r\n\\r\n•ICT and Geography, including the use of GIS\\r\n\\r\n•Creative approaches to learning\\r\n\\r\n•Debates concerning the links between school and university geographies\\r\n\\r\nWhere possible progress of students in teaching and learning skills and understanding will in part be developed through the creation of curriculum ideas and resources with external partners (eg Afghan Action) for wider use by the geographical educational community as well as on teaching placement.\\r\n\\r\n\\r\nGeography students will form part of a Humanities subject group along with History, RE and Social Science for generic sessions. There will also be a programme of Geography subject enhancement sessions. This approach recognises the need for flexibility and adaptability required of the Humanities based teacher. \\r\n\\r\nContinuous assessment is used throughout the course.  There are no examinations.\\r\n\\r\nApplications are welcome from students with good/very good qualifications in their Geography qualifications at GCSE and AS/A level (or equivalent) and at honours degree level. \\r\n\\r\nApplications are also welcome from students with a Joint or Combined Honours degree in which Geography is one of the major subjects. \\r\nStudents with related degrees such as Geology or Environmental Studies may also apply. \\r\n\\r\nA good A level Geography qualification would be viewed very positively. \\r\n\\r\n",

The interview is not a daunting process but rather a discussion about your suitability and preparation for going into teaching. During the interview, you will explore any additional preparation needed to help put you in the best possible position to engage successfully with the course from the start.",
    "OtherRequirements": "Admission to the course is subject to a satisfactory medical report.

In planning your placements, your subject tutor will try to balance the distance you are asked to travel with your individual needs and our knowledge of our wide range of school partners. \\r\n\\r\nPhase A\\r\nAfter induction you will spend about 8 weeks in your Phase A placement school.  You will build on existing experience and develop new skills with support from the school's Coordinator for Initial Teacher Education and a subject mentor who will oversee your professional development during the placement and liaise closely with your university tutor who will also support you. \\r\n\\r\nPhase B\\r\nDuring your second placement you will spend about 14 weeks in a different school, also supported by a mentor, ITE Coordinator and university tutor.
