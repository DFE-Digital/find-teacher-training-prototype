    "TrainWithUs": "At Manchester Met, you won’t just develop the practical and organisational skills you’ll need to teach a subject in the classroom. You’ll explore how children learn and factors that can affect the way we learn, from our environment to our teachers.\\r\n\\r\nYou will look at the latest educational research, identifying how research might help you in the classroom, perhaps when you’re dealing with children’s behaviour or you’re investigating if there’s a new way to teach a topic.\\r\n\\r\nWe offer University-led and School-led routes into teaching both Primary and Secondary education.\\r\n\\r\nBoth routes lead to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and include 60 masters level credits (a full-time masters degree typically consists of 180 credits, and you can usually put your 60 credits towards your masters).\\r\n\\r\nWe work with over 500 primary schools and over 400 secondary schools across the North West region. This means you could experience placements in inner city or rural settings, mixed or single gender, faith schools, selective or comprehensive schools. This variety helps you to experience different situations and develop your practical skills as a teacher in different settings.\\r\n\\r\nYou can also choose from over 20 secondary subject specialisms. Maybe you’re excited to share your love of Shakespeare or perhaps you can’t wait to hear your year 7 class share their first words in Mandarin. Or, you’re already thinking of all of the incredible science experiments you’ll show your class. \\r\n\\r\nYou will learn in a diverse community of students, replicating the environment you will experience in schools.\\r\n",
