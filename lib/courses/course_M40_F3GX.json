The interview is not a daunting process but rather a discussion about your suitability and preparation for going into teaching. During the interview, you will explore any additional preparation needed to help put you in the best possible position to engage successfully with the course from the start.",

Leicester is ideally placed to offer the opportunity to work in both inner city and rural environments, with learners from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds. We try to place students in contrasting schools to ensure you have a rich and varied experience in your initial training year and that you have the opportunity to teach across the 11-18 age range.\\r\n\\r\nThe placements are referred to as 'Phase A' and 'Phase B' placements.\\r\nPhase A.  In planning your placements, your subject tutor will try to balance the distance you are asked to travel with your individual needs and our knowledge of our wide range of school partners. \\r\n\\r\nPhase A\\r\nAfter induction you will spend about 8 weeks in your Phase A placement school.  You will build on existing experience and develop new skills with support from the school's Coordinator for Initial Teacher Education and a subject mentor who will oversee your professional development during the placement and liaise closely with your university tutor who will also support you. \\r\n\\r\nPhase B\\r\nDuring your second placement you will spend about 14 weeks in a different school, also supported by a mentor, ITE Coordinator and university tutor.

    "TrainWithUs": "At Manchester Met, you won’t just develop the practical and organisational skills you’ll need to teach a subject in the classroom. You’ll explore how children learn and factors that can affect the way we learn, from our environment to our teachers.\\r\n\\r\nYou will look at the latest educational research, identifying how research might help you in the classroom, perhaps when you’re dealing with children’s behaviour or you’re investigating if there’s a new way to teach a topic.\\r\n\\r\nWe offer University-led and School-led routes into teaching both Primary and Secondary education.\\r\n\\r\nBoth routes lead to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and include 60 masters level credits (a full-time masters degree typically consists of 180 credits, and you can usually put your 60 credits towards your masters).\\r\n\\r\nWe work with over 500 primary schools and over 400 secondary schools across the North West region. This means you could experience placements in inner city or rural settings, mixed or single gender, faith schools, selective or comprehensive schools. This variety helps you to experience different situations and develop your practical skills as a teacher in different settings.\\r\n\\r\nYou can also choose from over 20 secondary subject specialisms. Maybe you’re excited to share your love of Shakespeare or perhaps you can’t wait to hear your year 7 class share their first words in Mandarin. Or, you’re already thinking of all of the incredible science experiments you’ll show your class. \\r\n\\r\nYou will learn in a diverse community of students, replicating the environment you will experience in schools.\\r\n",
