    "AboutCourse": "Professional Studies\\r\n\\r\nEvery aspect of the programme is focused upon developing trainees as professionals. Schools are involved in the recruitment and selection of trainees and want to employ the most competent of teachers in their schools. The central training sessions address the key areas of professional practice including: - assessment, lesson planning, behaviour management, Safeguarding Level 1, Data and Progress 8, EAL, Inclusion and Diversity, Literacy, Phonics, Numeracy and Special Educational Needs and Disability; this training continues for trainees in their schools.  Subject specific training is also delivered centrally and continues under the guidance of mentor and PT.  St Mary’s University deliver all elements of the PGCE academic reading and writing.\\r\n\\r\nCurriculum Studies\\r\n\\r\nThe training programme is designed to develop subject knowledge and understanding of the current curriculum issues in the chosen subject or phase of training. \\r\nIn the classroom\\r\nThe programme is designed to develop pedagogical skills. The school- based training begins with observations of experienced practitioners where trainees learn to identify key elements of a successful lesson. Small group teaching, team teaching and co -planning of lessons are integral to build confidence and expertise. With this experience, trainees begin to develop all the skills of an outstanding teacher, independently and confidently planning and teaching. By the end of the training programme they will be teaching 70 -80% of a newly qualified teacher.\\r\n\\r\n The Assessment of Trainees\\r\n\\r\nFor the successful completion of the course, trainees must demonstrate competence against all the QTS standards, and need to have successfully completed the Skills Tests before the course begins. Trainees will be continually assessed through lesson observations. The Professional Tutor will complete a TPR each half-term which documents the progress made in each of the Standards.   This is moderated by the PLT.  Throughout the year, evidence will be collected in lesson observation, training and subject knowledge file and evidence against the standards collated in a final presentation file.  This evidence is also moderated by St Mary’s University.\\r\n",

In addition, entrants are required to sign a declaration that they have not previously been excluded from teaching or working with children.\\r\n\\r\nSchool experience is a desirable characteristic but not essential and no applicant would be rejected because of a lack of school experience.  \\r\n",
    "PersonalQualities": "We are looking for enthusiastic applicants with very good communication skills, the determination to succeed, a commitment to working hard and the ability to work with others. Successful applicants are confident and passionate about teaching and also able to contribute to the wider school ethos and community. Training to teach is both challenging and rewarding.

    "HowSchoolPlacementsWork": "All trainees teach in two schools during their training year. Their second school placement is chosen to provide a different context to their main school experience.  Trainees will have a mentor and PT in this placement.  A Partnership Link Tutor (PLT) is assigned to each trainee; each half term she/he will visit the trainee in school to support, observe and QA the school-based experience to moderate and to ensure consistency of training across the Partnership."
