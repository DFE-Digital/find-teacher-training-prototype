Hispanists, Germanists and those with main French work with each other, sometimes working in language specific groups. There is a varied programme of tutor inputs, seminars, workshops and student presentations with considerable collaborative learning. Students are also required to undertake research and other independent learning tasks including data-collection from the classroom. \\r\n\\r\nThe ERASMUS programme enabling students to do part of their School Experience abroad is also a unique feature of this course available, although not guaranteed, for a small number of students who meet the requirements. \\r\n\\r\n[Course Information](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught-courses/pgce-modern-foreign-languages.aspx)",

This involves one long placement with a 6-week placement at another school within the CTA in the spring term before you return to your original school for the remainder of the course. \\r\n\\r\nAt the start of the academic year we will contact all registered trainees to confirm the area where you are living and to ask about the type of school that you would like to be placed in for your second placement. Where possible, we will try to accommodate your request and placements are arranged with a maximum commuting distance of 1 hour 15 minutes based upon the address provided. Travel time is usually significantly less than this.\\r\n\\r\nWe are able to offer contrasting placements in single-sex or mixed schools and in schools with sixth forms where your main placement school is 11-16.  Where you have completed a placement in a single-sex school your second placement will be in a mixed school or a school with students of the opposite sex.\\r\n\\r\nShould you have any questions relating to the placement structure, please do not hesitate to email c.barclay@catholicteachingalliance.org.uk for more information.\\r\n"
