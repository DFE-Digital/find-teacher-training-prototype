    "AboutCourse": "Our one-year Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) prepares you to teach the religious education secondary school curriculum.\\r\n\\r\nYou will consider the purpose of religious education in schools, exploring topics from the purpose of life to morality.\\r\n\\r\nYou will look at creative ways to teach your classes about religious education, such as through drama, art, and class trips.\\r\n\\r\nTypically, you will visit places of worship from the six major religions and engage in dialogue with people from other faiths and cultural backgrounds. It’s a fantastic opportunity for you to discover places across Greater Manchester for your own class trips, once you’re a qualified teacher.\\r\n\\r\nWhen you’re at Manchester Met, you’ll mainly study with your PGCE Religious Education group. You’ll consider how to plan lessons, reflect on your planning, learn how research can develop your teaching practice, and look at ways to develop your teacher persona. \\r\n\\r\nYou will also reflect on topics that sit across the curriculum in schools, such as pastoral care, Personal, Social, Health and Economic Education (PSHE), and Citizenship. This helps you to develop subject knowledge that you can use in your future teaching career.\\r\n\\r\nYou won’t simply learn teaching methods with us on-campus though – you’ll teach classes in schools too. \\r\n\\r\nYou will spend at least 120 days on placements in schools, gradually  increasing your involvement to become  the class teacher.\\r\n",

When you are offered an interview, we will send you a detailed information pack containing everything you need to know in order to prepare effectively for your interview, but here is what you can expect.\\r\n\\r\nIf you have applied to study one of our PGCE Secondary courses, you will have a welcome presentation from our Admissions Tutor to start with, followed by a subject-based interview that usually lasts around 30 minutes.  This will be with the subject tutor and a representative from one of our partnership schools.\\r\n",

    "TrainWithUs": "Our Partnership offers subject-specialist training in 8 secondary subjects.

As a designated 11-19 provider you are guaranteed training and direct experience of A level/BTEC teaching as part of your programme. We also offer comprehensive training in generic elements such as behaviour management, pastoral care and working with pupils with SEND.\\r\n\\r\nThroughout the year, you will be supported by a subject specialist university tutor, as well as dedicated mentors in Partnership schools. The support that we offer is highly praised by our student teachers, and in the last two years, 99% of student teachers rated the quality of their training with us as either good or very good.\\r\n\\r\nYou are also able to take advantage of being part of a research-intensive university which offers the opportunity to benefit from cutting edge research in areas such as neuroscience and education. As part of the University’s Green Apple Project, we encourage our student teachers to focus on ‘sustainable education’ for the future.\\r\n\\r\nTypically, over 50% of those qualifying with us choose to remain in the Bristol area and have successfully secured teaching posts within our partnership schools by the end of the PGCE year. Many of our student teachers progress quickly in their careers, taking on roles such as subject leader and head of year. A number have gone beyond this, joining senior leadership teams.",
    "TrainWithDisability": "We welcome applications from candidates with disabilities and other needs and, within the context of University of Bristol support structures, we make reasonable adjustments to ensure that the programme is accessible to all. When a specific need is declared, offer holders are assessed by the University’s Occupational Health department and recommended to liaise with our Disability Service to ensure a Learning Support Plan can be put in place.\\r\n\\r\nMany lectures are audio-recorded and are made available via our VLE. When possible, lecture slides and handouts are made available to the whole cohort at least 24 hours in advance of the session. All University buildings are accessible including ramp/lift access. In cases where student teachers are required to move around the University campus to attend lectures, provision is made to support them, as appropriate. The University works closely with placement schools to ensure that needs are met whilst on teaching practice. For example, a student teacher with hearing disabilities was placed in a school that could provide carpeted classrooms.\\r\n\\r\nThe University has a comprehensive support structure to support students with a wide range of medical conditions, including mental health. This includes support from the Personal Tutor, the Senior Tutor and Programme Director, Professional Services staff as well asdepartment-based Student Welfare Advisors. If appropriate, student teachers can be referred to the University’s specialist Counselling Service or Occupational Health team.
