    "AboutCourse": "This course is a School Direct @Exeter programme. This means that you will attend the taught PGCE programme at the university as ‘infill’ trainees.  You are registered with the university and are eligible for training bursaries and student loans. You will be  based in school in September, before the taught course and in periods of non-contact time during the autumn term. The majority of the rest of your time is spent at your home school, with a second placement of approximately six weeks at a contrasting school.\\r\n\\r\nIn addition to school based work, the course includes science education workshops,National Curriculum courses designed to help develop to GCSE level your subject knowledge of the areas of science outside your specialism and to show you ways to teach these topics to pupils. There are subject specialist courses to develop to A-level your specialist subject knowledge and to show you ways to teach these topics to pupils. There are also subject support groups in which students teach aspects of their own specialism to each other. You may also have the opportunity to learn through weekend field courses.\\r\n\\r\nFive seminar days are held at the University during school placements. \\r\n\\r\n\\r\n",
    "CourseLength": "OneYear",
    "Qualifications": " Good GCSE grades in ‘double science’ or in each of the three separate science subjects. You  will have a good ‘A’ level grade in biology and ideally in another science subject and a good degree (first or upper second class Honours) with at least 50% of the content related to biology. Equivalent or alternative qualifications are always considered.\\r\nRead more at (https://www.exeter.ac.uk/teachertraining/secondary/science/biology/#OpKTi14f1B3FqrGW.99)\\r\n\\r\nGCSE at grade C+/4+ in maths and English.",
    "HowSchoolPlacementsWork": "Placement schools are self selecting. Within the JCTSA partnership schools identify the subjects in which they wish to train a teacher. This means that biology is only offered in those specific schools. If you are offered and accept a place in that school, it then is designated as your home school and the bulk of your teaching practice will take place there. Your second placement will be in a contrasting school. This will be within the alliance of schools but you may have to travel. All of our schools are rural and are located in West Dorset, Chard and Devon. For the most part, all our secondary schools are 11-18 schools. All of the placement schools are designated as good or outstanding by Ofsted."
