    "AboutCourse": "The School Direct Training Programme (fee funded/unsalaried)\\r\nThis year, St. John's CE Primary School (Provider code 15D) is hoping to offer 30 school direct (fee funded/unsalaried) placements to graduates who have little or no work experience. This path into teaching is a great way to gain the qualifications and practical skills you need to become a teacher. It enables those who have a degree to combine teacher training with actually doing and learning on the job, focusing on the 'Teachers' Standards' and leading to the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). These places are School Direct only. \\r\nAll our partnership schools are in the Epping Forest and Harlow areas and are accessible by Central Line Tube, Overground or major bus routes. \\r\nThis course will be based in one school for the majority of the training period with a second placement in a contrast school setting. Part of the course is theory based and there will be formal training days held mainly in the training room. Trainees are awarded Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) upon completion of the programme. \\r\nOur Teacher Educators and Tutors are excellent teachers that attend training and meet regularly to further develop their skills and enable them to pass on feedback, coaching and classroom observation. \\r\nYour professional responsibilities will include assessing, planning and teaching the primary curriculum. \\r\nSchool Direct requires a commitment of 5 days a week for 10 months from September to July. Trainees are expected to participate fully in the everyday life of the schools in which they train and, therefore, occasional evening or extra-curricular events will be obligatory. \\r\nFurther information can be found on our website \\r\nhttp://www.westessexscitt.co.uk/School-Direct-ITT\\r\n",

You must be able to demonstrate an ability to communicate clearly and grammatically in both spoken and written Standard English. You must have passed the English and Maths professional skills tests. All overseas qualifications will need to be verified by NARIC\\r\n",

These are subject to: \\r\nSatisfactory references and satisfactory medical assessment. Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check and National and Local Terms and Conditions of Employment. \\r\n\\r\nIt is the duty of all schools to protect vulnerable children and adults. If you are offered a place on the programme, a DBS check is a vital entry requirement for this training programme. \\r\n",
