This involves examining a range of appropriate learning and teaching strategies through Key Stages 3-5 in the varied classroom situations you will encounter.

    "HowSchoolPlacementsWork": "JCTSA schools decide on an individual basis in which subjects they wish to offer training. This means that you are applying to a specific school to study your subject. Your contrasting school experience will be as close as possible to your home school but you will need access to a car.\\r\nThere are two school placements. The majority of your in-school experience is done in your home school. This is the school to which you applied for your place. In addition there will be a six-week placement to a contrasting school. \\r\nThe majority of our schools are 11-18 and are judged as good or outstanding. They are all rural and are located in West Dorset, Chard and in South East Devon. \\r\n"
