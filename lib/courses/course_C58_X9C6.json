Placements also provide you with the opportunity to connect with potential employers and build your professional network.\\r\n\\r\nAt Secondary level we have strong relationships with around 80 schools in the local and surrounding area. It is a testament to the strength of these partnerships and the regard with which our graduates are held, that most schools in Berkshire employ at least one graduate of the Institute of Education.\\r\n\\r\nOn your Secondary PGCE course you are required to carry out three placements in two different age groups - ensuring you receive a broad range of experiences. Two placements must be undertaken in a school setting but the third can be taken in a different setting - allowing you to sample teaching in an alternative environment.\\r\n\\r\nWe offer our students an unusually flexible and broad range of settings and educational environments - you will have the opportunity to gain experience in special needs schools, Pupil Referral Units, independent schools, museums, and charities.\\r\n\\r\nYou will have plenty of opportunities throughout your course to apply your developing skills in real settings.
