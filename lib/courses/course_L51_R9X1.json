University sessions include a large amount of practically based activities to help you develop your skills. You will have the opportunity to acquire an understanding of the demands of the National Curriculum orders for modern foreign languages. The work in schools will be closely linked with the university-based sessions so that you will have the opportunity to use a range of up-to-date language resources, including ICT, to set up active and engaging learning activities. \\r\n\\r\nFor more information please visit our website here. \\r\n(https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/postgraduate-courses/pgce-secondary/pgce-secondary-modern-foreign-languages-specialism/)\\r\n",

You may be asked to discuss a portfolio where relevant, or to give a presentation. \\r\n\\r\nThere will also be a written task, where you will be asked to write a short piece on the role of your subject within the national curriculum. This is to check your Spelling, Punctuation and Grammar, and to see what your response would be to writing at Master’s level.\\r\n\\r\nThese interview elements are not intimidating, but carefully planned to give you the best possible opportunity to show your potential for teaching and working with young people in school.

    "TrainWithUs": "Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU) has a long established reputation for providing high quality Teacher Training, working in close Partnership with over 300 committed, welcoming and diverse schools across the North West. \\r\n\\r\nOur academic team is made up of successful teachers who maintain strong links with schools and professional bodies, ensuring you receive the most up-to-date training during your course. Our most recent OFSTED inspection acknowledged that: “all trainees are very well prepared to teach their chosen age range and specialist subject”. Employment rates are consistently above average for the sector.\\r\n\\r\nMost Teacher training courses offer a PGCE Award which is worth 60 credits at Masters Level. LJMU, is one of a small number of teacher training providers that offers a Post Graduate Diploma in Education and Qualified Teacher Status. This means that our beginning teachers graduate with 120 Masters level credits. Many  go on to complete a Masters in Education Practice during their early career.\\r\n\\r\nOur emphasis is on developing inclusive and reflective practitioners. Our courses ensure that LJMU teachers develop a deep understanding of the curriculum, learners and learning. This enables them to provide the very best and most appropriate learning opportunities for all children and young people, with a positive impact on all learners’ development and achievements. \\r\n\\r\nSchool-based experience takes place largely in a Home School, supported by  mentors. Shorter placements are also provided in contrasting school settings. This variety ensures that our students can confidently plan, teach and manage learning in different settings and socio-economic contexts.\\r\n",
    "TrainWithDisability": "LJMU is committed to Equality of Opportunity and proud of the help we offer. The Disability Advice Team will help you access the support you need.

By contacting the team before you begin and disclosing your disability, you'll be able to receive support from when you arrive. Email: disability@ljmu.ac.uk Tel: 0151 231 3164/3165.\\r\n\\r\n If you need an Individual Student Learning Plan (ISLP) which sets out the type of support you may need and who is responsible for ensuring your support is in place, this will be put in place by an LJMU Disability Adviser once you have met to discuss your needs. Once finalised, your plan will be sent to you via email. As soon as you have agreed the ISLP it will be sent to your Disability Coordinator and then, with your agreement, passed on to the relevant academic and support staff.\\r\n\\r\nAll trainees are encouraged to disclose any specific learning need that they experience, in order to make any adjustments, both at LJMU and within our Partner Schools. As part of the enrolment process to Teacher Training Programmes all students are required to complete a Health Questionnaire and some may be asked to attend a screening appointment with our Occupational Health Unit. This is designed to ensure that arrangements are in place, from the outset, to support any students who may need additional support or reasonable adjustments to be made.\\r\n",
