    "AboutCourse": "This Post Graduate Certificate Education (PGCE) Secondary Modern Foreign Language course leads to the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), qualifying you to teach the 11-18 age group in secondary schools in England and Wales.\\r\n\\r\nThe programme has consistently been judged as excellent in both internal and external reviews, and is widely acknowledged as one of the best modern foreign language courses in the country.\\r\n\\r\nYour tutors are a diverse and incredibly experienced community of academics with wide practical experience in schools and international reputations as experts in the field of Modern Foreign Language teaching and learning.\\r\n\\r\nThe PGCE will provide you with a theoretical framework for language teaching closely integrated with practical advice on the preparation and delivery of effective and engaging language lessons. Your assignments are designed to help you to plan your teaching effectively and imaginatively and to evaluate your skills, particularly in terms of the quality of learning achieved by pupils.\\r\n\\r\nYou will be taught through a series of lectures, practical seminars and workshops, where interactive and discussion-based techniques will encourage you to engage, reflect and challenge. Sessions may include:\\r\n\\r\n* participating in workshop style sessions with your peers\\r\n* attending presentations by subject experts\\r\n* working on tasks in groups\\r\n* having individual tutorials\\r\n* visits to schools or other education settings\\r\n* visits to theatres, museums, galleries or sites of educational interest\\r\n* writing assignments on aspects of subject teaching and Professional Studies\\r\n\\r\nThese learning activities will help you to develop a toolkit of knowledge and skills, ensuring you are well prepared to tackle challenges and opportunities throughout your training and your career.\\r\n\\r\nAlongside the University tutors, you will be taught and guided by a team of committed and experienced University-trained school mentors.",
    "CourseLength": "OneYear",
    "Qualifications": "We would normally expect you to have a 1st, 2:1 or 2:2 honours degree (or equivalent from a university outside the UK) in a subject that is related to the subject that you intend to teach.  You will also need to have achieved  Grade 4 (or C) or above in GCSE Mathematics and English Language or equivalent qualifications. \\r\n\\r\nYou will also be required to pass the QTS skills tests in numeracy and literacy.",

    "HowSchoolPlacementsWork": "Placements enable you to develop the skills and knowledge valued and desired by employers - you will build your confidence in the classroom and gain practical teaching experience. Placements also provide you with the opportunity to connect with potential employers and build your professional network.\\r\n\\r\nAt Secondary level we have strong relationships with around 80 schools in the local and surrounding area. It is a testament to the strength of these partnerships and the regard with which our graduates are held, that most schools in Berkshire employ at least one graduate of the Institute of Education.\\r\n\\r\nOn your Secondary PGCE course you are required to carry out three placements in two different age groups - ensuring you receive a broad range of experiences. Two placements must be undertaken in a school setting but the third can be taken in a different setting - allowing you to sample teaching in an alternative environment.\\r\n\\r\nWe offer our students an unusually flexible and broad range of settings and educational environments - you will have the opportunity to gain experience in special needs schools, Pupil Referral Units, independent schools, museums, and charities.\\r\n\\r\nYou will have plenty of opportunities throughout your course to apply your developing skills in real settings. In schools, you will be involved in:\\r\n\\r\n* observation of other teachers\\r\n* planning and teaching parts of lessons/small groups\\r\n* planning and teaching lessons and sequences of lessons\\r\n* reflecting on and evaluating your teaching\\r\n* receiving feedback on your teaching\\r\n* gaining experience of the range of responsibilities of classroom teachers"

    "TrainWithUs": "The Grand Union Training Partnership is a school-centred initial teacher training (SCITT) consortium centred on a number of 11-18 comprehensive schools situated in villages and small towns West of Northampton and in Milton Keynes. \\r\n\\r\nWe provide Secondary PGCE courses in Business Studies, English, History, Modern Foreign Languages, Physical Education, Maths, Geography, Computer Science, Physics, Chemistry and Biology. \\r\n\\r\nWe aim to give trainees, whom we refer to as Associate Teachers, as much practical experience of working in the Partnership schools as possible. Each Associate Teacher's work and programme of study is supervised by a Mentor (School Based Tutor) who will take a close interest in their development as a subject teacher and colleague. This part of the course is complemented by general professional studies. \\r\n\\r\nOur overall aim is to produce reflective professionals confident in applying for and starting their first jobs as secondary school teachers. Over half of our Associate Teachers take up their first teaching posts in the scheme's Partnership schools. ",
    "TrainWithDisability": "In addition to supporting our Associate Teachers in any way we can, we are committed to providing additional support where possible and necessary.\\r\n\\r\nPrior to the start of our course, we ask all Associate Teachers to consider whether or not they have a disability within the statutory definition.  It is important that we gather this information because The GUTP is committed to ensuring that all of our Associate Teachers are treated fairly and that we do not inadvertently make decisions or have processes that may treat any one less well on the basis of any disability. We also wish to offer appropriate support to all our trainees, whatever their circumstances.  All information given to us is treated with sensitivity and held in confidence.  \\r\n",
