We have pupils from Reception to GCSE split across two sites. We are situated in a rural location and serve many small villages, with the secondary phase offering places to pupils from over 30 villages. The catchment area provides a mix of backgrounds. The school has close links with the other schools in the cluster and across the west of the county. \\r\n\\r\nThe school was inspected by Ofsted in November 2015 when we were judged to be a “good school”. The report states: “Teachers provide effective learning opportunities and engage well with pupils. Teachers plan lessons that help pupils make good progress from their individual starting points. Pupils make good progress. The school’s work to promote pupils’ personal development and welfare is outstanding.”",
