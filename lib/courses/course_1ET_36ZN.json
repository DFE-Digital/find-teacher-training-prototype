    "AboutCourse": "At St Marylebone you will work with experienced teachers, first of all observing and team teaching, then teaching independently. This is complimented by a placement of about 6 weeks’ teaching in another school. \\r\nWe have been successively rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted and SIAMS,  and are one of the best performing non-selective state schools nationally. \\r\nWe are based in in the fantastic Marylebone High Street with all the attractions of central London nearby and the benefits of excellent transport links. Nearest tube stations: Baker Street, Regents’ Park. You will be able to develop your career in a beautiful school with excellent facilities and positive links with parents and the vibrant local community. \\r\n\\r\nThe course content is organised into six modules, the first three of which may be worked on concurrently.\\r\nTraining Module 1A: Lesson planning. How to plan lessons well, including choosing the most appropriate teaching and learning strategies.\\r\nTraining Module 1B: Behaviour. How to manage pupils during lessons, and motivating them towards learning.\\r\nTraining Module 1C: Assessment. How to assess pupils' learning in each subject, and use assessment information when planning and teaching lessons.\\r\nTraining Module 2: Meeting needs of different groups of pupils. How to ensure that all groups of pupils do as well as possible e.g. those who speak English as an additional language, high attaining pupils, those with special educational needs.\\r\nTraining Module 3: The wider context of teaching and learning in schools today. Barriers to learning i.e. why some pupils do not do as well as they should, and how teachers can make a difference to this.\\r\nTraining Module 4: Subject teaching. Bringing everything together, how to teach really effectively. This builds on all the earlier training in how to teach effectively, and involves an in-depth study of an aspect of subject teaching.\\r\nThere are two formal assignments: an essay exploring aspects of meeting the needs of different groups of pupils (linked to Training Module 2), and a subject-related essay (linked to Training Module 4).\\r\nPGCE\\r\ne-Qualitas collaborates with Leeds Beckett University, who offer a distance learning PGCE as an addition to the e-Qualitas QTS-focused training programme. The PGCE may be undertaken during the teacher training programme or afterwards (for workload reasons, we suggest that it is better to do it afterwards, as part of the continuing professional development of the induction year). Leeds Beckett charges £1500 for the PGCE. PGCE entry is in September\\r\n",
