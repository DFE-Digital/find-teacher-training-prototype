Teaching is through workshops, tutorials and lectures, some with guest speakers, and through group work with other teacher trainees from a variety of subject specialisms as well as specialist subject groups. \\r\n\\r\nDuring the course you'll study four modules: \\r\n* Curriculum Development \\r\n* Inclusion, Equality and Diversity \\r\n* Specialist Subject Development \\r\n* Developing Critical Professional Practice \\r\n\\r\nAssessment is typically through the completion of a range of classroom activities, written assignments, reports, personal subject audits and the development of portfolios of evidence.
