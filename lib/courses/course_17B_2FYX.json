It may be that several schools will express interest in you.  This method ensures you have an increased opportunity of a successful outcome. \\r\n\\r\nYou will usually be invited to interview where you will be asked to teach a  20 minute learning activity to a class of pupils. \\r\n\\r\nFollowing the learning activity, you will have an interview with the Professional Mentor and Head of Department.  Some schools may ask you to take part in a Student Panel, or to undertake an activity involving students.  \\r\n\\r\nIf all goes well, you will be told the decision and the UCAS website will be updated accordingly. \\r\n\\r\n",

    "HowSchoolPlacementsWork": "The major benefit of School Direct is being able to select the school in which you are going to do the majority of your training.  This choice is often influenced by location and distance travelling from home.\\r\n\\r\nUsually you will spend most of your time at your base school, with one day a week spent at your university (weekly with Warwick and fortnightly with Derby).\\r\n\\r\nWe also have a number of Alliance Days where we deliver part of your training to all trainee teachers from across the partnership.\\r\n\\r\nYour complementary placement takes place after Christmas, usually during the first half of the Spring Term.  This is usually set up within the partnership schools and in many cases will be a straight swap between trainees doing the same subject.  All the schools within the partnership are within a 30 minute drive of The Polesworth School, which is the Lead School in the Partnership.\\r\n\\r\nTrainees are also required to undertake a minimum of 5 days in a primary setting.\\r\n\\r\nAs well as your university mentor, you will have access to a professional mentor and subject mentor at your base school.  You will have support every step of the way and will not be expected to fly solo until you feel you're ready to do so.  The expectation is that by the time you finish your course you should be teaching around 70% of a teacher's full timetable.\\r\n\\r\nYou will also be required to undertake a number of written tasks set by the university that will contribute towards a Masters Degree should you wish to complete one. Also, you will be collecting evidence throughout the year to complete your personal learning portfolio which you will use to demonstrate your learning journey. "

All staff (non-teaching and teaching) play a crucial role in the education of young people. We all understand how our work has a direct influence on the life chances of the young people in our care.
