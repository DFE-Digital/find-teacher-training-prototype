    "AboutCourse": "The PGCE Secondary course is a full time, one year Initial Teacher Education qualification introducing you to the requirements for teaching to the 11 – 16 age range. Where appropriate, opportunities to experience post 16 provision will be available. It has been designed to enable trainees to demonstrate evidence of having met the Teachers’ Standards that lead to Qualified Teacher Status. All trainees undertaking the University-led PGCE route into teaching will work towards securing 60 Master’s level credits. This is an integral part of the programme. We strongly believe that innovative and effective teaching and learning is made possible through a teacher’s full engagement with research informed practice and underpinning theories of learning. This is fostered in two modules and developed through School Based Training. Trainees on the PGCE Secondary programme will be well supported in becoming critically reflective teachers capable of inspiring their pupils to learn, achieve and flourish.\\r\n\\r\nAt the University of Hertfordshire, trainees will be supported and taught by specialist tutors with excellent experience, knowledge and research informed expertise. Partnership schools provide opportunities for trainees to learn about pedagogical approaches relevant to their subject specialism and the professional responsibilities of all teachers.\\r\n\\r\nYou will have two School Based Training placements, where, with the support of a teacher mentor and a university subject tutor, you will develop your skills to become an excellent classroom teacher.
