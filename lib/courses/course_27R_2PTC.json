    "AboutCourse": "The NEXUS programme offers a one year, full-time course, based on the academic year starting in September. \\r\n\\r\nOur vision is to develop and prepare the teachers of tomorrow with the skills and knowledge they need to deliver creative and challenging teaching and learning in the Primary setting. The programme has been designed to ensure that you are expertly trained as a Primary teacher to take up your post as an outstanding NQT and is enhanced by attending training at the CLF SCITT. \\r\n\\r\nRight from day one, trainees are treated as a member of staff and take part in all aspects of school life including attending all staff meetings and other CPD opportunities. Trainees attend one days joint training a week and then put their learning into practice straight away back in school so it really is learning on the job. Trainees work with their school-based mentor, who is responsible for supporting and guiding their professional development, ensuring that they have the opportunities that they need both within the school and drawing on expertise from other NEXUS schools. \\r\n\\r\nThe staff in our schools are our most valuable resource and have a proven track record for delivering high quality training and professional development. They have high expectations and are eager to share their skills, knowledge and practice with the next generation of teachers - they are in the best position to prepare trainee teachers for excellence in their own practice. They endeavour to support trainees in many different ways through coaching and mentoring, observations and feedback to ensure that they have the best possible preparation and training.\\r\n\\r\nTraining in school progresses from observing and working alongside an experienced teacher to taking full responsibility, firstly for groups, and later for the whole class as the academic year progresses. Progress is assessed through regular formal and informal monitoring of teaching competencies leading to profile reviews and assignments which link education/subject theory with the teaching and learning in the classroom. \\r\n\\r\nThe University aspect of the course brings together theory and practice and is carefully timetabled to ensure the work load dis not too high.\\r\nTrainees have access to their extensive library, resources and tutor for support. \\r\n\\r\nWhen you qualify, you will achieve a PGCE with QTS.\\r\n",

This will include working with a small group of children. During the interview, we will have an informed discussion with candidates on teaching and learning, subject knowledge, the curriculum and previous school and/or setting experience. The interview will also explore your commitment and potential to become a teacher, including your professionalism and ability to manage the challenges and pressures of the course.\\r\n\\r\nSuccessful candidates will be offered a place on the course subject to the completion of the QTS skills tests (English, Maths) by a specified date. We strongly recommend that candidates sit these tests as soon as they register their application.\\r\n",

We work with our trainees to look at their strengths and interests in order to choose the right placement school for them. All of our placement schools are within a 2 mile radius.

    "TrainWithUs": "NEXUS Teaching School Alliance are a group of ten schools in South Glos (on the edge of Bristol) who work together to provide high quality, school led teacher training. With all of the schools being good or outstanding, you will learn from excellent teachers who are keen to share their expertise. Each of our schools has their own specialism including one school with a resource base for children with visual impairments and/or physical disabilities and another for children with social and communication needs. \\r\n\\r\nEven though the schools are in a 2 miles radius, they all have different contexts giving you a really good grounding in teaching. We will work with you to identify your strengths and interests to find the best placement school for you. You will spend a large percentage of time in the class, applying what you have learnt straight away and we will make you feel like part of the school team from day one. \\r\n\\r\nWe are extremely proud of our work with trainee teachers and are committed to developing great teachers for the future. As we only have a small cohort of trainees, we really get to know you and tailor the training to suit individuals. We want the best possible teachers for our children and the majority of our trainees go on to gain a full time teaching position in one of our schools. ",
