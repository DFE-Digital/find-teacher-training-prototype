    "Qualifications": "A  good Honours degree in Spanish (minumum of a 2:2). Other qualifications of degree level equivalence will be considered, e.g. Final Diploma of Institute of Linguists. \\r\nNative speakers of Spanish should hold a qualification equivalent to a UK degree at a minumum of a 2:2.  The qualifications can be in any subject, since they have, by definition, the necessary language skills. \\r\n\\r\nTrainees in French, German and Spanish must have a second language (even if only at beginners' level) as this will help with the provision of placements, as well as finding a teaching post.\\r\n\\r\n",
    "InterviewProcess": "Interviews will take place in the home school. You will be interviewed by the head of department, a member of the leadership team and a teacher with responsibility for initial teacher training. Before the interview day, but as part of the interview process, you will be expected to arrange a visit to the school. On the interview day itself you will be asked to observe a lesson and discuss what you notice and you will be asked to work with a small group of students for part of a lesson, supporting them through an activity prepared by their teacher.",
    "HowSchoolPlacementsWork": "JCTSA schools decide on an individual basis in which subjects they wish to offer training. This means that you are applying to a specific school to study your subject. Your contrasting school experience will be as close as possible to your home school but you will need access to a car.\\r\nThere are two school placements. The majority of your in-school experience is done in your home school. This is the school to which you applied for your place. In addition there will be a six-week placement to a contrasting school. \\r\nThe majority of our schools are 11-18 and are judged as good or outstanding. They are all rural and are located in West Dorset, Chard and in South East Devon. \\r\n"
