    "AboutCourse": "The course structure is predominately school based with additional Professional Study training days.  Trainees are allocated a 'host school' but will also spend time in a second ('complementary') school.  Each trainee will be directly supervised by a school based Mentor.  This specially trained Mentor will organise such matters as school timetables, observe lessons, set targets and provide feedback to the trainee in regular progress meetings.  Additionally, each school has a Professional Tutor who maintains overall responsibility for all the trainees in that school.  The Professional Tutor will also be able to support the trainee and can organise additional training opportunities.\\r\n\\r\nRight from the start of the programme our trainees spend time in schools, including Royal Wootton Bassett Academy (home of the North Wiltshire SCITT), learning about various aspects of education.  After the initial induction period the trainees begin their own teaching practice in the first of two school placements, where they will begin by observing classes and working alongside the class teacher.  Over time this will progress to team-teaching and small group teaching.  Later in this initial placement trainees should be looking to take on responsibility for entire classes and be planning whole lessons or even a sequence of lessons.  As a guide, throughout the academic year trainees can expect to begin by following a 40% teaching timetable, which will gradually increase to a minimum of 80% by the end of the year.  By this point trainees should be developing high level teaching skills (planning, teaching and evaluating extending sequences of lessons and assessing students' progress).\\r\n\\r\nDuring the programme trainees will also spend time undertaking Professional Study sessions and Subject Specialist sessions at either Royal Wootton Bassett Academy or at one of our partner schools.\\r\n\\r\nIn addition to the two main school placements, trainees will have experience of a school out of the phase they are training for.  This is where primary trainees gain an understanding of secondary education and secondary trainees gain an understanding of primary education.  Also, an opportunity to experience an international context may be possible.  There may also be an opportunity for trainees to experience education in an alternative setting if this is deemed appropriate or if a trainee expresses a desire to gain such experience.\\r\n",
    "CourseLength": "OneYear",
