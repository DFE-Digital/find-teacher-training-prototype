    "AboutCourse": "Our one-year Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) prepares you to teach the religious education secondary school curriculum.\\r\n\\r\nYou will consider the purpose of religious education in schools, exploring topics from the purpose of life to morality.\\r\n\\r\nYou will look at creative ways to teach your classes about religious education, such as through drama, art, and class trips.\\r\n\\r\nTypically, you will visit places of worship from the six major religions and engage in dialogue with people from other faiths and cultural backgrounds. It’s a fantastic opportunity for you to discover places across Greater Manchester for your own class trips, once you’re a qualified teacher.\\r\n\\r\nWhen you’re at Manchester Met, you’ll mainly study with your PGCE Religious Education group. You’ll consider how to plan lessons, reflect on your planning, learn how research can develop your teaching practice, and look at ways to develop your teacher persona. \\r\n\\r\nYou will also reflect on topics that sit across the curriculum in schools, such as pastoral care, Personal, Social, Health and Economic Education (PSHE), and Citizenship. This helps you to develop subject knowledge that you can use in your future teaching career.\\r\n\\r\nYou won’t simply learn teaching methods with us on-campus though – you’ll teach classes in schools too. \\r\n\\r\nYou will spend at least 120 days on placements in schools, gradually  increasing your involvement to become  the class teacher.\\r\n",

We do not accept the following qualifications as equivalent to GCSE: Adult Numeracy or Literacy, Functional Skills or Key Skills\\r\n\\r\nAll PGCE applicants must pass Professional Skills Tests in Numeracy and Literacy.

    "InterviewProcess": "Part of the process of applying to study a PGCE course with us is for you to join us at Brooks building for an interview where we can get to know you better and you can demonstrate the skills you have that will make you a great teacher. When you are offered an interview, we will send you a detailed information pack containing everything you need to know in order to prepare effectively for your interview, but here is what you can expect.\\r\n\\r\nIf you have applied to study one of our PGCE Secondary courses, you will have a welcome presentation from our Admissions Tutor to start with, followed by a subject-based interview that usually lasts around 30 minutes.  This will be with the subject tutor and a representative from one of our partnership schools.\\r\n",
    "OtherRequirements": "A Disclosure and Barring Service Check and DfE Fitness to Teach test are also required. \\r\n\\r\nSubject to a satisfactory declaration in relation to the Childcare Disqualification Regulation Act 2009 \\r\n",

    "HowSchoolPlacementsWork": "We try to organise a range of school experiences for you across your two core placements. This helps you to develop your practical teaching skills and explore the types of schools you could work in when you graduate.\\r\n\\r\nWe have partnerships with primary and secondary schools across the North West region. As a trainee teacher, you’ll be expected to travel up to 90 minutes to your placement school.\\r\n"

    "TrainWithUs": "At Manchester Met, you won’t just develop the practical and organisational skills you’ll need to teach a subject in the classroom. You’ll explore how children learn and factors that can affect the way we learn, from our environment to our teachers.\\r\n\\r\nYou will look at the latest educational research, identifying how research might help you in the classroom, perhaps when you’re dealing with children’s behaviour or you’re investigating if there’s a new way to teach a topic.\\r\n\\r\nWe offer University-led and School-led routes into teaching both Primary and Secondary education.\\r\n\\r\nBoth routes lead to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and include 60 masters level credits (a full-time masters degree typically consists of 180 credits, and you can usually put your 60 credits towards your masters).\\r\n\\r\nWe work with over 500 primary schools and over 400 secondary schools across the North West region. This means you could experience placements in inner city or rural settings, mixed or single gender, faith schools, selective or comprehensive schools. This variety helps you to experience different situations and develop your practical skills as a teacher in different settings.\\r\n\\r\nYou can also choose from over 20 secondary subject specialisms. Maybe you’re excited to share your love of Shakespeare or perhaps you can’t wait to hear your year 7 class share their first words in Mandarin. Or, you’re already thinking of all of the incredible science experiments you’ll show your class. \\r\n\\r\nYou will learn in a diverse community of students, replicating the environment you will experience in schools.\\r\n",

The University works with disabled students to ensure they are not disadvantaged as a result of their disability.\\r\n\\r\nBefore accepting a place, disabled applicants should explore how the university might be able to meet any additional study support or accommodation needs they may have. This should be done at the earliest opportunity by contacting the Disability Service on 0161 247 3491 or (disability.service@mmu.ac.uk)",
