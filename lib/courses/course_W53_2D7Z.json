    "AboutCourse": "The Physical Education course prepares students to teach all areas of National Curriculum Physical Education at Secondary level. It develops reflective practitioners through an evaluative process of their own knowledge and skills. An audit of skill is conducted to ascertain the levels of knowledge; this is enhanced by a strong programme reinforced with opportunities to obtain Governing Body Awards. Trainees are supported and encouraged to develop ideas in the delivery of the attainment targets in Physical Education across the six practical activity areas. The course reflects the very latest teaching in Physical Education responding to the needs and changes within our Consortium of Schools and the National Curriculum. GCSE, A level, BTEC and leadership courses in Physical Education and Sport are experienced by all trainees and resources for all courses are explored. Use of Information and Communications Technology is studied and a range of information handling skills are utilised to enhance teaching and learning."
