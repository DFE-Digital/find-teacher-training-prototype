    "AboutCourse": "QUALIFICATION OUTCOME\\r\n \\r\nThis course 37F8 leads to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).  Further clarity on the significance of different teacher training qualifications can be found [here](http://www.wltsa.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/primary-courses/qualification-outcomes/) .\\r\n\\r\nSPECIAL FEATURES\\r\n\\r\nThis course is run by the West London Teaching School Alliance (WLTSA) as Provider (in partnership with (and accredited by) St Mary’s University, Twickenham.  \\r\n\\r\nWLTSA enables you to choose your host school at application.  If there is a teaching vacancy in your school and they are keen to retain you, you can be employed for the following year without the post being advertised.  By becoming a WLTSA trainee, all our 43 primary schools could employ you this way; we operate a pool. \\r\n \\r\nOur aim is to produce exceptional teachers who can then remain in alliance schools, continuing to further their career with the benefit of our continuing professional development.\\r\n\\r\nTRAINING\\r\n\\r\nYour training is predominantly at your host (employing) school other than\\r\n* 13 days at the university;  \\r\n* your second placement at a contrasting WLTSA school for approx. 6 weeks post February half term up to the Easter holidays.  \\r\n\\r\nYou register with the university and meet your university support tutor who will work with you on a needs analysis for a Training Plan (TP) in term one. This will be reworked in term two and three between you, your school mentor and university support tutor.  \\r\n\\r\nAt school, through an initial programme of observations you will become familiar with the organisation and working of the school (pupil groups and pastoral systems, staffing, curriculum, resources, facilities, approaches to learning and teaching, lesson planning and assessment). \\r\n\\r\nFrom the beginning, you will be treated like a member of staff.  With your school mentors you will feel supported as you progress and become ready to teach. Our mentors are excellent teachers and undertake rigorous training to develop their mentoring skills. In school, you will have the opportunity to develop your teaching expertise and relationships with children in a familiar environment. \\r\n\\r\nYou will have the opportunity to teach a range of year groups (children aged 5-11) in Maths, English and Science as well as other subjects and themed projects. You will have experience of the National Curriculum and teacher assessment.     \\r\n\\r\nThroughout your time in both schools, your university tutor visits you and your school mentors.  University elements of the programme cover teaching and assessing; classroom management; child protection; English, Maths and Science.  WLTSA also provides additional opportunities /seminars.  \\r\n",
    "CourseLength": "OneYear",
    "SalaryDetails": "The successful candidate will be paid a salary by the employing host school in line with the ‘Non-Qualified Teacher Pay Range 2019-20’, normally at the Point 1 level.  This government pay range is expected to be published in Sept. 2019.\\r\n\\r\nOne exception to this is Free Schools who set their own salary levels, usually fairly close to the government pay range.\\r\n\\r\nAs a guide, Point 1 on the Unqualified Teacher Pay Range in 2017-18 was:\\r\n* £20,909 (for a school in Inner London)\\r\n* £19,749 (for a school in outer London)\\r\n\\r\nThe tuition fee for this course will be covered by WLTSA.\\r\nTrainees on salaried courses are not eligible for bursaries or student loans. \\r\n\\r\nPlease note that we are unable to sponsor anyone who would otherwise not have the right to take up employment in this country. \\r\n",
    "Qualifications": "* A UK undergraduate honours degree or an equivalent qualification at 2:2 or above.\\r\n* Five GCSEs at least at Grade C (or grade 5 for GCSEs sat in 2017 onwards) or the equivalent) including English Language, Mathematics and Science.   \\r\n* A ‘pass’ in the [DfE Literacy and Numeracy Skills Tests](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/how-to-apply/passing-the-skills-tests]\\r\n\\r\nWhere appropriate, please read our important guidance [Overseas Qualifications & GCSE Equivalency Tests](http://www.wltsa.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/primary-courses/overseas-quals-gcse-equivalency/).  \\r\n\\r\nOffers will be conditional on satisfactory outcome of a Disclosure & Barring Service check and an occupational health check both administered through the host school after an offer is accepted.\\r\n",
    "InterviewProcess": "On receipt of your UCAS application this will be considered by the named host school, in collaboration with the WLTSA centrally and the university.  This process is administered by the WLTSA Teaching School office.\\r\n\\r\nIf shortlisted for interview, you attend a single interview session at your chosen host school (normally in the morning). This includes a tour of the school; WLTSA literacy/numeracy tests; a classroom exercise and panel interview.  The university joins us for these interviews.\\r\n\\r\nWe try to ensure that you have at least a week’s notice of interviews. \\r\n\\r\nThe WLTSA literacy and numeracy tests are quite separate to the DfE Skills Tests referred to in the Course Requirements. Usually candidates have not taken the DfE Skills Tests when they come to interview and our own (very short) tests help us identify those who may need to do more practice papers ahead of the skills tests and those who are unlikely to pass them. \\r\n",
    "OtherRequirements": "A realistic understanding of both the role of a teacher and some current issues facing the profession is important. It can really help to spend a couple of days observing relevant lessons in a state primary to strengthen your application but this is not a strict requirement in itself.  [Top tips for getting some observational experience (primary)](http://www.wltsa.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/primary-courses/school-experience/).\\r\n\\r\nA level of maturity (irrespective of age) to operate as a responsible salaried member of staff is vital.  \\r\n\\r\nIf you wish to train at one of our faith schools, they will also be looking for someone sympathetic to the values of their faith.",
    "PersonalQualities": "We want you to have passion and enthusiasm.  We need trainees who can engage and inspire students to a love of learning, who are:   \\r\n\\r\n*committed to championing their students;\\r\n*open to learn about children’s physical/social/emotional/cognitive needs and how these can affect behaviour;\\r\n*in good health with the ability to cope with stress.  Teaching is incredibly rewarding, but it also requires an element of resilience!\\r\n*professional and committed to equal opportunities;\\r\n*able to communicate well in written/spoken English, with at least basic computer skills and commitment to developing these.\\r\n*have a sense of humour and an ability to laugh at yourself.  \\r\n",
    "HowSchoolPlacementsWork": "With WLTSA you select the main host school at application.  We then later arrange your second placement at another contrasting WLTSA school to provide greater depth to your training experience. \\r\n\\r\nCHOOSING YOUR SCHOOL\\r\n\\r\nThe characters and location of our schools are varied.  When deciding on your preferred host school, we need you to consider where you might eventually like to work and how accessible it is to where you live.\\r\n\\r\nThe schools seeking trainees on this particular course are listed below.  \\r\n \\r\nBrunswick Park Primary School, SE5\\r\nJack Tizard School, (SEN), W12\\r\nJohn Betts Primary School, W6\\r\nLittle Ealing Primary School, W5\\r\nMarlborough Primary School, SW3\\r\nOur Lady of the Visitation Catholic Primary School, UB6\\r\nPark Walk Primary School, SW10\\r\nPield Heath House School (SEN),\\r\nQueens Manor Primary School, SW6\\r\nQueensmill School, W12\\r\nRavenor Primary School, UB6\\r\nSir John Lille Primary School, SW6\\r\nSt Mary's Catholic Primary School, W10 \\r\nSulivan Primary School, SW6\\r\nWest London Free School Primaries (3 schools W6 & W14)\\t\\r\n\\r\nYou can read descriptions of each of these schools in our overall [WLTSA Primary School Summary Descriptions](http://www.wltsa.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/primary-courses/wltsa-primary-school-summary-descriptions/).

You can make three choices overall when you apply.\\r\n\\r\nTHE TECHNICAL BIT!\\r\n\\r\nYou don’t have to restrict yourself to one school within a course, but each school would count as one application and you get three choices overall in Round 1.  Please also be aware that we have so many partner schools that we have been forced to split artificially on UCAS into three provider names.  See [How to apply & how to choose more than one school on a course](http://www.wltsa.org.uk/initial-teacher-training/primary-courses/how-to-apply-how-to-choose-more-than-1-school-on-a-course/).  \\r\n\\r\nBE STRATEGIC WHEN YOU APPLY\\r\n\\r\nYou can always ring us up to ask how many applications (if any) are being considered by different schools at the point that you are about to apply.  We also keep our website up to date so that you can see which schools have already shortlisted and are interviewing. \\r\n"
