    "FeeDetails": "Tuition fees for the 2019/20 academic year are yet to be confirmed.\\r\n\\r\nAs an indication of what you might pay, the fee for students who started in September 2018 was:\\r\n•\\t£9,250\\r\n\\r\nPGCE students can apply for loans from Student Finance England and may be entitled to a tax-free bursary -https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/funding-and-salary/overview\\r\n\\r\nFind out more about scholarships and funding on our website - https://le.ac.uk/study/postgraduates/fees-funding/scholarships-discounts\\r\n\\r\n",
    "AboutCourse": "The PGCE Social Science course aims to prepare you to meet the NCTL Standards fully and to teach Advanced level Psychology and/or Sociology with confidence and authority.\\r\n\\r\nThe PGCE Social Science aims to:\\r\n•Introduce you to the variety of strategies and techniques available to the teacher in the modern education system; \\r\n\\r\n•Model the above strategies and techniques in University sessions; \\r\n \\r\n•Guide you to a set of principles which will allow you to operate as effective practitioners in new and challenging situations; \\r\n\\r\n•Introduce you to wider issues which confront Social Science teachers; and\\r\n\\r\n•Inform you about current developments in education which impinge upon their role as Social Science teachers.\\r\n\\r\nAll training will be done as a Social Science group, though where appropriate, specialist psychology and sociology sub-groups are formed. In addition, all students are required to teach one or more Humanities, PSHE, Citizenship and/or vocational courses.\\r\n\\r\nThe Social Science subject specialism will cover a variety of areas including:\\r\n•Psychology/Sociology\\r\n\\r\n•Personal and Social Education\\r\n\\r\n•Vocationalism\\r\n\\r\n•ICT and Social Sciences\\r\n\\r\n•Examination and Assessment Issues\\r\n\\r\n•Citizenship\\r\n\\r\nContinuous assessment is used throughout the course and there are no examinations.\\r\n\\r\nSelection for the Social Science course is based on the general qualities required by the University of Leicester course as a whole. However, there are three other issues that applicants need to note: \\r\n•  To support your readiness for the school workplace, the course aims to give you a wide range of teaching experience across the Social Sciences. This means that you may be expected to teach Sociology and Psychology, as well as Health & Social Care, as part of your school placement. \\r\n\\r\n•  As the Social Sciences have a limited presence in the pre-16 curriculum, successful applicants will show that they have the knowledge to teach outside of the social science curriculum, usually in the form of some Humanities pre-14 or Vocational teaching pre-16. To support Social Science students with this they may, at times, form part of a Humanities subject group along with History, Geography, RE and Citizenship specialists for generic sessions. \\r\n\\r\nOther options for pre-16 teaching may be acceptable. However, there are limitations on the range of subjects that might be reasonably provided for in the PGCE Social Science course. \\r\n\\r\n•  As competition for places on the Social Science course is fierce, early application for a place on the Social Science course is advised. \\r\n",

    "InterviewProcess": "If invited for interview, you will meet members of the course team who will give an overview of the course and answer any questions you may have. \\r\n\\r\nYou will participate in a group task with candidates from a range of subjects and give a brief presentation as part of a small group. \\r\n\\r\nSubject tutors will introduce a written subject task that you will complete during the day and you will have an individual interview with a subject tutor. The interview is not a daunting process but rather a discussion about your suitability and preparation for going into teaching. During the interview, you will explore any additional preparation needed to help put you in the best possible position to engage successfully with the course from the start.",
    "OtherRequirements": "Admission to the course is subject to a satisfactory medical report. The University will provide more information about this should you be offered a place.\\r\n\\r\nAll offers are subject to a satisfactory enhanced DBS disclosure.

    "PersonalQualities": "The Secondary PGCE is a challenging course, and we are looking for applicants with a wide range of skills, knowledge, experiences and an aptitude for teaching.  These skills also include the ability to form relationships,  good communication skills, a commitment to learning and teaching and reflective qualities. \\r\n\\r\n",
    "HowSchoolPlacementsWork": "You will undertake two secondary teaching placements in our Partnership Schools. Leicester is ideally placed to offer the opportunity to work in both inner city and rural environments, with learners from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds. We try to place students in contrasting schools to ensure you have a rich and varied experience in your initial training year and that you have the opportunity to teach across the 11-18 age range.\\r\n\\r\nThe placements are referred to as 'Phase A' and 'Phase B' placements.\\r\nPhase A.  In planning your placements, your subject tutor will try to balance the distance you are asked to travel with your individual needs and our knowledge of our wide range of school partners. \\r\n\\r\nPhase A\\r\nAfter induction you will spend about 8 weeks in your Phase A placement school.  You will build on existing experience and develop new skills with support from the school's Coordinator for Initial Teacher Education and a subject mentor who will oversee your professional development during the placement and liaise closely with your university tutor who will also support you. \\r\n\\r\nPhase B\\r\nDuring your second placement you will spend about 14 weeks in a different school, also supported by a mentor, ITE Coordinator and university tutor.

    "TrainWithUs": "At Manchester Met, you won’t just develop the practical and organisational skills you’ll need to teach a subject in the classroom. You’ll explore how children learn and factors that can affect the way we learn, from our environment to our teachers.\\r\n\\r\nYou will look at the latest educational research, identifying how research might help you in the classroom, perhaps when you’re dealing with children’s behaviour or you’re investigating if there’s a new way to teach a topic.\\r\n\\r\nWe offer University-led and School-led routes into teaching both Primary and Secondary education.\\r\n\\r\nBoth routes lead to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and include 60 masters level credits (a full-time masters degree typically consists of 180 credits, and you can usually put your 60 credits towards your masters).\\r\n\\r\nWe work with over 500 primary schools and over 400 secondary schools across the North West region. This means you could experience placements in inner city or rural settings, mixed or single gender, faith schools, selective or comprehensive schools. This variety helps you to experience different situations and develop your practical skills as a teacher in different settings.\\r\n\\r\nYou can also choose from over 20 secondary subject specialisms. Maybe you’re excited to share your love of Shakespeare or perhaps you can’t wait to hear your year 7 class share their first words in Mandarin. Or, you’re already thinking of all of the incredible science experiments you’ll show your class. \\r\n\\r\nYou will learn in a diverse community of students, replicating the environment you will experience in schools.\\r\n",
