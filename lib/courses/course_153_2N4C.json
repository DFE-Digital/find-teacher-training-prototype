    "AboutCourse": "The SCITT  programme is a 42 week full time course. The programme is designed to be relevant to the demands of the modern classroom and leads to enhancement of the quality of teaching and learning. \\r\n\\r\nYou will be trained in a highly supportive classroom environment in which you will develop the knowledge, understanding and skills necessary to deliver challenging, creative and personalised lessons. \\r\n\\r\nThe programme provides you with 80 days of professional development, for example, in the core curriculum, foundation subjects and professional studies.   These sessions provide the opportunity to participate and to engage with the subject knowledge of the national curriculum, and the wider pedagogical and social theories around education. This is delivered through taught sessions at Green Lane CE Primary School. Each session is led by an outstanding practitioner or SLE working within a partnership school. Sessions are personalised to your specific needs and draw on expertise within school. \\r\n\\r\nYou will spend a minimum of 120 days in three different school settings across the primary age range, working for an extended period of time each term in a different school environment. High Force Education SCITT believes this creates the most diverse, versatile and adaptable teacher. Each practice provides a supportive environment to allow you to develop confidence in the classroom, observe good practice teaching, carry out focused case studies with pupils and engage in continued professional dialogue with school colleagues, to support you in developing into a truly reflective practitioner. \\r\n\\r\nPart of the assessment process involves three written assignments (Level 6 and Level 7) on specific aspects of teaching and learning. Successful completion of the assignments at  Level 7 will give you 60 Masters credits.  You will also be observed teaching and produce an assessment file that demonstrates you are meeting the Teachers' Standards.  \\r\n\\r\nAs part of the personalised package offered every trainee is assigned a supportive Professional Tutor who challenges you to achieve your full potential. You will be treated like a member of staff within their school and will attend staff meetings and development days making you part of the team from day one. Each school also has a mentor who you will work with for the duration of the placement. \\r\n\\r\nAs part of the programme, we can offer you some unique opportunities including spending time within a pupil referral unit, a special school and a residential to a SCITT in Bradford.
