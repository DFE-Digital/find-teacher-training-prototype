    "AboutCourse": "Our PGCE Primary has been running for over 60 years and schools tell us we are developing the kind of teachers they want to employ. This is reflected in 98% of our students achieving Good or Outstanding teacher grades at the end of their course and 95% of our graduates securing a teaching post by the end of the course.\\r\n\\r\nTutors on the Primary PGCE course all have extensive experience as classroom teachers and are specialists in a wide range of educational areas. These strengths are recognised within the Primary PGCE course, both in the specialist course options offered, and through the expert contributions to all strands of the course.\\r\n\\r\nYou will be required to select a specialism at the beginning of your PGCE. In addition to Maths and Lower Primary, other options may include Inclusion, Science, and English (subject to availability).   If you choose Lower Primary (3-7) you will specialise in Foundation and Key Stage 1, whereas Primary focuses on Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2\\r\n\\r\n\\r\nThe course comprises of three strands and school placements:\\r\n•\\tCurriculum Studies - Core and Broader Curriculum\\r\n•\\tProfessional Studies\\r\n•\\tAcademic Strand including Specialist Study\\r\n•\\tTeaching Experience in primary schools.  These placements will be in contrasting schools to provide you with a broad range of experience.\\r\n\\r\nTeaching approaches are varied; whole-course lectures, taught sessions in tutor groups, some work in focus schools and individual tutorials. Some of these sessions will be taught in differentiated groups, with specialist Primary and Lower Primary based sessions and small group subject support sessions.\\r\n\\r\nThe PGCE Primary course prepares you to teach across the full range of the Primary Curriculum. We will introduce you to the wider context of teaching, including responding to diversity in schools and the inclusion of Special Needs Education, as well as equipping you with classroom management and planning skills.\\r\n\\r\nBy the end of the course you will meet the required professional standards for Qualified Teachers Status (QTS) and will be awarded a University of Leicester PGCE. Our strong ethos of reflective practice will prepare you well for your future career in teaching.\\r\n\\r\n",

You will have the opportunity to observe skilled class teachers working and to discuss the things that underpin day-to-day classroom activities, as well as work alongside experienced teacher-mentors who will support your learning about classroom practice.\\r\n\\r\nTeaching Experience 1\\r\nThis is a six-week paired placement with two students working together in one class. This gives you the opportunity to work with a partner to develop classroom skills in a supportive environment. You will focus on developing observation skills to support your understanding of teaching and learning and to put your learning into practice. During this Autumn Term placement you and your partner will work towards taking an increased responsibility for teaching the class.\\r\n\\r\nTeaching Experience 2\\r\nThis takes place in the Spring Term and lasts for seven weeks. The amount of time spent teaching the class increases over the placement until you have responsibility for up to 80% of the timetable.\\r\n\\r\nTeaching Experience 3\\r\nThis is another seven-week placement in the Summer Term with students working towards taking responsibility for 80% of the teaching timetable.\\r\n\\r\nThroughout each of these placements you will be encouraged to participate fully in the life of the school and to take full advantage of the tasks and activities designed by your tutors to support your development. \\r\n\\r\nIt is expected that through your three placements you will gain experience across the age range that you are training to teach.\\r\n"
