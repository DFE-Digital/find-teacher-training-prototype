Both will be supervised by a trained mentor. \\r\nYour progress will be monitored and assessed through regular formal and informal monitoring of teaching competence, leading to profile reviews. \\r\n",
    "CourseLength": "OneYear",

    "InterviewProcess": "Applicants are selected from UCAS Teacher Training applications. \\r\nYou should write a full personal statement giving reasons for wanting to teach. You should cite any experience of working with children (although strongly recommended, this is not an essential requirement for application).\\r\nCareful consideration should be made to referees.

This will be at one of the TEACH Schools over the course of one day. The day will involve working with children in a classroom and reading a story to a class. \\r\nMore specific details about the interview days will be provided to candidates by email if successful in their application, so please provide a valid and regularly monitored email address on application forms. \\r\n\\r\nAll offers made will be subject to normal employment checks including DBS and medical clearance and the passing of the DFE professional skills tests in Literacy and Numeracy and, where necessary, satisfactory completion of degrees and other minimum qualification requirements. \\r\n",

    "HowSchoolPlacementsWork": "The 4 TEACH Poole Trust Schools have a long track record of providing a quality teaching and learning environment. Each school has a commitment to professional development as evidenced by many years’ experience working with trainees in initial teacher training in partnership with Poole SCITT. \\r\nLeaders in the 4 schools have been strongly involved in the writing and development of the course and mentoring and assessment. \\r\nTrainees will be assigned a trained mentor within each school who will be responsible for supporting and guiding professional development and ensuring that the trainee has the opportunities they need within the school. \\r\nAll trainees are required to undertake assessed training in both Key Stages 1 and 2 and school experience will be in one Key Stage for the majority of the year, with a short placement in the opposite Key Stage.\\r\nYou will be placed in schools that best help you to develop your professional practice. This could be across any of the schools in the TEACH partnership.\\r\nYour in-school experience will progress from observing and working alongside your class teacher to taking full responsibility, firstly for groups and later, for the whole class.\\r\n"
