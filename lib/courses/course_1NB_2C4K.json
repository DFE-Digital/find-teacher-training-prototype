    "AboutCourse": "Our ambition is to develop the next generation of teachers in an environment which provides the support and guidance necessary to be a successful practitioner. You will train within a local collaborative of schools all of whom are good or outstanding and who nurture the skills and talents of their teachers. We work in partnership with North Tyneside SCITT in order to deliver the highest quality training experience. \\r\n\\r\nWe offer training specialising in primary (5-11 year olds). The award of Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) is validated by Northumbria University.\\r\n\\r\nWe have developed our teaching programme to allow students to learn alongside experienced practitioners, learning on the job and being part of the school team from the start. You will help to build relationships with pupils, families and our communities, experiencing the ethos of high aspirations alongside a belief that every child really matters. You will meet pupils who strive to do their best and who enjoy learning and you will bring a unique set of skills which inspires them to go further. \\r\n\\r\nFor the duration of the programme you will be based at The Langdale Centre in Wallsend, Tyne and Wear and is located just off the A1058 Coast Road, in close proximity to the Silverlink Retail Park and within walking distance of Howdon Metro station.\\r\n\\r\nThe course offers many layers of professional guidance both whilst centre-based and in schools to support and enable students to become highly effective primary teachers. The programme is structured around four distinct but inter-related modules. The four modules are:\\r\n\\r\n• Reflective Primary Teacher\\r\n• Curriculum Studies\\r\n• Critical Curriculum Studies\\r\n• Educational Placements\\r\n\\r\nA key strength of the programme is that the practical and taught elements are strongly linked. Each week trainees spend time in schools in addition to assessed block placements; this enables the taught the taught elements of the course to be firmly grounded in classroom experience.\\r\n\\r\nThe programme has no formal examinations. Instead you will be assessed through written assignments and practical work in school. The assessed school placements represent a vital component of this assessment.\\r\n\\r\nThe standards for Qualified Teacher Status require you to be successful in all areas, and from the outset you will be involved in auditing your own learning and setting targets for your own professional development.\\r\n",
