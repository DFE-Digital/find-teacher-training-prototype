You will have specialist inputs on your chosen subject and also gain experience of issues in planning and teaching cross-curricular work within the Humanities.

It is an exciting and relevant subject which plays a major role in helping children to develop a better understanding of the increasingly complex world around them.\\r\n\\r\nPGCE Secondary Geography aims to:\\r\n\\r\n•Broaden and deepen your knowledge and understanding of Geography for teaching purposes; \\r\n\\r\n•Provide you with an informed and critical view of National Curriculum, CSE, A level and relevant vocational requirements; \\r\n\\r\n•Raise awareness and provide experience of a broad range of learning and teaching strategies; \\r\n\\r\n•Develop your skills in classroom management, planning, communication, assessment, recording and evaluation; \\r\n\\r\n•Understand the differing needs of those with learning difficulties and very able students; and\\r\n\\r\n•Raise your awareness of a wide range of assessment strategies\\r\n\\r\nThe Geography subject specialism will run throughout the academic year and will cover a variety of areas including:\\r\n•Planning and curriculum in Geography\\r\n\\r\n•Approaches to student learning\\r\n\\r\n•Thinking skills\\r\n\\r\n•Enquiry based learning\\r\n\\r\n•Fieldwork\\r\n\\r\n•ICT and Geography, including the use of GIS\\r\n\\r\n•Creative approaches to learning\\r\n\\r\n•Debates concerning the links between school and university geographies\\r\n\\r\nWhere possible progress of students in teaching and learning skills and understanding will in part be developed through the creation of curriculum ideas and resources with external partners (eg Afghan Action) for wider use by the geographical educational community as well as on teaching placement.\\r\n\\r\n\\r\nGeography students will form part of a Humanities subject group along with History, RE and Social Science for generic sessions. There will also be a programme of Geography subject enhancement sessions. This approach recognises the need for flexibility and adaptability required of the Humanities based teacher. \\r\n\\r\nContinuous assessment is used throughout the course.  There are no examinations.\\r\n\\r\nApplications are welcome from students with good/very good qualifications in their Geography qualifications at GCSE and AS/A level (or equivalent) and at honours degree level. \\r\n\\r\nApplications are also welcome from students with a Joint or Combined Honours degree in which Geography is one of the major subjects. \\r\nStudents with related degrees such as Geology or Environmental Studies may also apply. \\r\n\\r\nA good A level Geography qualification would be viewed very positively. \\r\n\\r\n",
