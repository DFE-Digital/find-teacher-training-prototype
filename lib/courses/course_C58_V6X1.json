    "AboutCourse": "Our one-year Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) prepares you to teach the religious education secondary school curriculum.\\r\n\\r\nYou will consider the purpose of religious education in schools, exploring topics from the purpose of life to morality.\\r\n\\r\nYou will look at creative ways to teach your classes about religious education, such as through drama, art, and class trips.\\r\n\\r\nTypically, you will visit places of worship from the six major religions and engage in dialogue with people from other faiths and cultural backgrounds. It’s a fantastic opportunity for you to discover places across Greater Manchester for your own class trips, once you’re a qualified teacher.\\r\n\\r\nWhen you’re at Manchester Met, you’ll mainly study with your PGCE Religious Education group. You’ll consider how to plan lessons, reflect on your planning, learn how research can develop your teaching practice, and look at ways to develop your teacher persona. \\r\n\\r\nYou will also reflect on topics that sit across the curriculum in schools, such as pastoral care, Personal, Social, Health and Economic Education (PSHE), and Citizenship. This helps you to develop subject knowledge that you can use in your future teaching career.\\r\n\\r\nYou won’t simply learn teaching methods with us on-campus though – you’ll teach classes in schools too. \\r\n\\r\nYou will spend at least 120 days on placements in schools, gradually  increasing your involvement to become  the class teacher.\\r\n",
