    "TrainWithDisability": "At Southampton we welcome applications from candidates with disabilities and other needs. SEND is a very important element of our training throughout the PGCE, and trainees who have personal experiences of SEND are of real benefit to our programmes, as they bring a wealth of experience.\\r\n\\r\nHow are Trainee Teachers with disabilities and other needs supported?\\r\n\\r\n* Trainees with dyslexia meet together at the start of the course for an informal session, led by a tutor with significant SEND experience. This group is then enabled to support one another throughout the course, with individual, personalised, input from the tutor as required.\\r\n* Trainees with Physical Disabilities are always accommodated as appropriate and a wide variety of modifications are available.  For example, a student with a hearing impairment may be supported by our enabling services, as well as by their Personal Academic Tutor with services such as remote transcription available - we work with individuals to ensure that their needs are met both when in University and when teaching in schools.\\r\n* We recognise that teaching can be stressful. The University offers a variety of services for Trainees who may be suffering from anxiety or depression, for example trainees can access talking therapies via the University Enabling Services. Trainees are also encouraged to make full use of their Personal Academic Tutor.\\r\n* The course team are able to personalise many aspects of the programme, to accommodate need on an individual basis, to enable successful completion of the course.\\r\n",
