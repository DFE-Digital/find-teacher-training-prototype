    "AboutCourse": "The course is designed to help you fulfil a wider teaching role (including that of pastoral care) within your chosen educational context. Throughout the course, we place particular emphasis on providing equal opportunities for all students working in a diverse, multi-ethnic society.\\r\nThis course will provide you with a PGCE at Masters level and Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). Working closely with Bradford specialist staff, both in placement schools, you will gain the knowledge, skills and understanding needed to be a newly qualified teacher.\\r\nStructure \\r\nA strength of the course is the way in which theory and practice are related as a result of extensive time spent working with children in at least two placement schools.\\r\nAt least 120 days are school-based with support provided by experienced school mentors.\\r\nLearning methods \\r\nThe course builds upon the subject knowledge and independent study skills which, as a graduate, you will have already acquired. Our school based sessions are also concerned with the professional skills which all teachers need. Course tutors work closely with managers, mentors and teachers in our school to provide you with advice and support for the progressive development of your teaching expertise.\\r\nTeaching methods \\r\nA large proportion of your teaching and training will be in our school, delivered by both highly experienced, inspiring school teachers and leaders. School based sessions consist of lectures, seminars tutorials, micro-teaching environments and observations of teaching in school and, where relevant, workshop or lab work.   This is very much a practical course, where you learn by doing.\\r\nAssessment \\r\nAssessment is carried out across both placements against the Teaching Standards.  Based largely in our school, you will have one other main assessed school placement. We offer our trainees a Key Stage 5 (A- level) enhancement.  You will also have the opportunity to get experience of a primary school, alternative provision or special school.\\r\n \\r\nYou will work alongside experienced teachers and mentors, who will provide advice and support. You will be introduced to your new role in stages, beginning with observation and work with individual pupils, then with small groups, eventually leading to your work with full classes.\\r\n\\r\nSchool Placement\\r\nYou will work alongside experienced teachers and mentors, who will provide advice and support.
