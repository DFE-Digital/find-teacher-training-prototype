    "AboutCourse": "Located in the heart of London, PGCE courses at King’s are rated Outstanding by Ofsted with excellent tutors on hand to support you through your training. In the last research assessment exercise, the department was rated second in the UK (REF, 2014). You will have the opportunity to work with experienced tutors who are actively engaged in research in their subject and in pedagogy more widely. 96% of 2017 graduates who sought teaching posts were employed within 6 months of qualifying. In our 2018 student survey, 92% of trainees rated the quality of their training as very good or good. \\r\n\\r\nThe PGCE Computing at King's trains Computing professionals and graduates to become effective teachers of Computing in secondary schools. The PGCE Computing programme examines in detail the specifications and expectations for Computing in UK secondary schools including GCSE and A-Level courses.\\r\n\\r\nLearning to be a teacher of Computing involves:\\r\n\\r\n* learning about teaching the Computing knowledge, skills and processes as laid down in the National Curriculum and examination specifications for Computing, Computer Science and Information Technology.\\r\n* learning how to incorporate computational thinking into other subject areas in schools.\\r\n\\r\nA distinctive feature of the King's Computing programme is the emphasis on learning through critical reflection and discussion with colleagues. In the same way that you will encouraged to make your students think when they are analysing computing-based issues and problems, so staff at King's are keen for you to apply your developing understanding of teaching to help you think about your own practice.\\r\n\\r\nAt King’s we are at the forefront of research into computing education in schools, and this research impacts on the teaching in the programme. We also co-run the Computing At School (CAS) Regional Centre for London, running many professional development and networking events for teachers of Computing. Our PGCE students can get involved in all these activities.\\r\n\\r\nThis course aims to prepare students to:\\r\n* become effective secondary school teachers\\r\n* become knowledgeable subject specialists who can progress to take on responsibilities in curriculum development\\r\n* become good classroom managers\\r\n* become successful form tutors and collaborative colleagues.\\r\n\\r\n[Course Information](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught-courses/pgce-computing.aspx)",

    "HowSchoolPlacementsWork": "School Direct trainees start at their chosen school during the first week of the autumn term. Term dates will be confirmed upon acceptance of an offer.\\r\n\\r\nThe university course starts in the second week of September and is full-time until late June. Sessions are usually from 9:30 to 4:30 but much of the time is spent in schools and you are usually expected to be in school by 8:00 or 8:30. The course is very intensive and most students find that they are not able to do part-time work during this time.\\r\n\\r\nAround half of the 38 schools within the Catholic Teaching Alliance offer training placements. Those who are able to support the main placement are listed for each respective course. \\r\n\\r\nCandidates usually apply to schools that are located close to where they live and we are happy to arrange tours and an observation day in your preferred school prior to application. \\r\n\\r\nWhen applying please select your preferred school.  Once your application passes our vetting process you will be invited to interview at KCL followed by an interview at the school.\\r\n\\r\nWe offer an ABA placement route, this includes a 6-week placement at another school within the CTA in the spring term before you return to your original school for the remainder of the course. Your two placements will cover the 11-18 age group.\\r\n\\r\nAt the start of the academic year we will contact all trainees to confirm where you live and to ask about the type of school that you would like to be placed in for your second placement. Where possible, we will try to accommodate your request and placements are arranged with a maximum commuting distance of 1 hour 15 minutes based upon the address provided. Travel time is usually significantly less than this.\\r\n\\r\nWe are able to offer contrasting placements in single-sex or mixed schools and in schools with sixth forms where your main placement school is 11-16.  Where you have completed a placement in a single-sex school your second placement will be in a mixed school or a school with students of the opposite sex. \\r\n"
