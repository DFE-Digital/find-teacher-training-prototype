    "AboutCourse": "Our Post Graduate Certificate Education (PGCE) Primary - the Early Years pathway leads to the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) giving you the experience, the opportunity and the knowledge to work in both Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) settings and Infant/Primary school settings.\\r\n\\r\nThe EYFS is a unique phase of education which involves learning through play and first hand experiences both inside and outdoors. This phase leads into Key Stage 1, when children really start to engage with learning to read, applying their mathematical knowledge and making sense of how the world works.\\r\n\\r\nChoose the Early Years pathway if you are interested in early learning and early child development. In choosing this pathway you will experience both the EYFS and Key Stage 1 phases and therefore be highly skilled in two curricula. If you are interested in the rewards and challenges of being an Early Years expert teacher choose this pathway.\\r\n\\r\nTutors are internationally or nationally renowned and their research regularly has a direct impact on school curricula and learning techniques, both in the UK and abroad. As experts in their field, their research also directly informs the focus and content of your course.\\r\n\\r\nLearning takes place through a series of lectures,, practical seminars and workshops, where interactive and discussion-based techniques will encourage you to engage, reflect and challenge. Sessions may include:\\r\n\\r\n* participating in workshop style sessions with your peers\\r\n* attending presentations by subject experts\\r\n* working on tasks in groups\\r\n* having individual tutorials\\r\n* visits to schools or other education settings\\r\n* visits to theatres, museums, galleries or sites of educational interest\\r\n* writing assignments on aspects of subject teaching and Professional Studies\\r\n\\r\nAlongside the University tutors, you will be taught and guided by a team of committed and experienced University-trained school mentors.",
