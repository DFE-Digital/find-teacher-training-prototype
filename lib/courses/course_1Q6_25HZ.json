    "AboutCourse": "Trainees will complete a total of 180 days of training; 120 days will be in the classroom observing and building up to whole class teaching as soon as possible.  The aim of school direct as opposed to the conventional PGCE is that trainees are more quickly immersed in the practicalities of teaching resulting in a more confident an competent teacher.  This is a school-based PGCE with more time spent in developing classroom practice than a traditional PGCE programme.  Training is delivered across the alliance by practising professionals\\r\n\\r\nThere will be 30 days of professional studies based around wider educational issues such as Behaviour Management, SEND and Assessment.  These will be delivered one day per week on a rotation basis by highly experienced teachers from schools in our partnership.  This ensures you are developing an understanding clearly based on classroom practice and how educational theory sits within this.  In addition there will be subject-based work in your chosen secondary subject.  Some of this will be achieved locally, but there may be a number of days where trainees will have to attend university based sessions.  \\r\n\\r\nThere will be three university based assignments throughout the year.  Access to the university resources and virtual learning will ensure you have access to wider educational texts and journals to support your work.  You can gain up to 60 masters level credits through completion of this course as this is a PGCE not QTS only.  This means your qualification is internationally recognised.\\r\n\\r\nApplicants need to have a 2:2 or a higher classification.
