    "AboutCourse": "Our one-year Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) prepares you to teach the religious education secondary school curriculum.\\r\n\\r\nYou will consider the purpose of religious education in schools, exploring topics from the purpose of life to morality.\\r\n\\r\nYou will look at creative ways to teach your classes about religious education, such as through drama, art, and class trips.\\r\n\\r\nTypically, you will visit places of worship from the six major religions and engage in dialogue with people from other faiths and cultural backgrounds. It’s a fantastic opportunity for you to discover places across Greater Manchester for your own class trips, once you’re a qualified teacher.\\r\n\\r\nWhen you’re at Manchester Met, you’ll mainly study with your PGCE Religious Education group. You’ll consider how to plan lessons, reflect on your planning, learn how research can develop your teaching practice, and look at ways to develop your teacher persona. \\r\n\\r\nYou will also reflect on topics that sit across the curriculum in schools, such as pastoral care, Personal, Social, Health and Economic Education (PSHE), and Citizenship. This helps you to develop subject knowledge that you can use in your future teaching career.\\r\n\\r\nYou won’t simply learn teaching methods with us on-campus though – you’ll teach classes in schools too. \\r\n\\r\nYou will spend at least 120 days on placements in schools, gradually  increasing your involvement to become  the class teacher.\\r\n",

We do not accept the following qualifications as equivalent to GCSE: Adult Numeracy or Literacy, Functional Skills or Key Skills\\r\n\\r\nAll PGCE applicants must pass Professional Skills Tests in Numeracy and Literacy.

When you are offered an interview, we will send you a detailed information pack containing everything you need to know in order to prepare effectively for your interview, but here is what you can expect.\\r\n\\r\nIf you have applied to study one of our PGCE Secondary courses, you will have a welcome presentation from our Admissions Tutor to start with, followed by a subject-based interview that usually lasts around 30 minutes.  This will be with the subject tutor and a representative from one of our partnership schools.\\r\n",

As a trainee teacher, you’ll be expected to travel up to 90 minutes to your placement school.\\r\n"

Courses are taught and supported by exceptional and dynamic staff. All of whom foster creativity, collaboration, innovation and student engagement at the heart of what they offer. We also value the link between the academic and the practice, and this will form a significant part of the ITT programme you undertake.\\r\n\\r\nThis year, UEL has achieved its best ever student satisfaction score and we officially have  the happiest students of any modern university in London, according to recent NSS league tables. To complement this, our end of programme survey outcomes in July 2018, suggest that over 95% of our teacher trainees rate the quality of their training through UEL as good or higher. Employability is also excellent with most subjects, phases and routes achieving 95-100% employment each year. \\r\n\\r\nUEL is an inclusive university and our teacher training programmes are highly diverse and multicultural. We are very proud of our trainee teachers, new and old, and what they have gone on to achieve in our schools. We are especially proud of the community we serve and how we take people from the local community who then go back into this community to teach - over 70% of our trainees find jobs within our partner schools each year. \\r\n\\r\nWe look forward to welcoming you to UEL and the Cass School of Education and Communities.",
