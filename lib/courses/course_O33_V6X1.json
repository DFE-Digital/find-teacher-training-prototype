    "AboutCourse": "Our one-year Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) prepares you to teach the religious education secondary school curriculum.\\r\n\\r\nYou will consider the purpose of religious education in schools, exploring topics from the purpose of life to morality.\\r\n\\r\nYou will look at creative ways to teach your classes about religious education, such as through drama, art, and class trips.\\r\n\\r\nTypically, you will visit places of worship from the six major religions and engage in dialogue with people from other faiths and cultural backgrounds. It’s a fantastic opportunity for you to discover places across Greater Manchester for your own class trips, once you’re a qualified teacher.\\r\n\\r\nWhen you’re at Manchester Met, you’ll mainly study with your PGCE Religious Education group. You’ll consider how to plan lessons, reflect on your planning, learn how research can develop your teaching practice, and look at ways to develop your teacher persona. \\r\n\\r\nYou will also reflect on topics that sit across the curriculum in schools, such as pastoral care, Personal, Social, Health and Economic Education (PSHE), and Citizenship. This helps you to develop subject knowledge that you can use in your future teaching career.\\r\n\\r\nYou won’t simply learn teaching methods with us on-campus though – you’ll teach classes in schools too. \\r\n\\r\nYou will spend at least 120 days on placements in schools, gradually  increasing your involvement to become  the class teacher.\\r\n",

When you are offered an interview, we will send you a detailed information pack containing everything you need to know in order to prepare effectively for your interview, but here is what you can expect.\\r\n\\r\nIf you have applied to study one of our PGCE Secondary courses, you will have a welcome presentation from our Admissions Tutor to start with, followed by a subject-based interview that usually lasts around 30 minutes.  This will be with the subject tutor and a representative from one of our partnership schools.\\r\n",

    "HowSchoolPlacementsWork": "We try to organise a range of school experiences for you across your two core placements. This helps you to develop your practical teaching skills and explore the types of schools you could work in when you graduate.\\r\n\\r\nWe have partnerships with primary and secondary schools across the North West region. As a trainee teacher, you’ll be expected to travel up to 90 minutes to your placement school.\\r\n"
