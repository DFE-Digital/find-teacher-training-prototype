We have a reputation for being amongst the best school-led teacher training providers in the country (Good Teacher Training Guide 2015 and 2017).\\r\n\\r\nOur School Direct Primary General with Mathematics Salaried programme is an employment based programme that leads to the award of QTS (Qualified Teacher Status).  A grant is provided by the government to subsidise an unqualified teachers' salary and to cover training costs.  Trainees are employed by a host school and will have the opportunity for a six week experience in a contrasting school and enhancement opportunities within the partnership of schools.   SSF will provide additional training for the required mathematical subject knowledge, research and pedagogy through Surrey Maths Hub, together with an opportunity to see high quality mathematic teaching in practice.\\r\n\\r\nTrainees are in school for four days each week and this includes some school based training time to observe experienced colleagues or undertake course requirements.  There is a gradual increase of teaching commitments working up to three to four days a week by July 2020.  One day each week is spent off site with your local cohort at professional studies training.\\r\n\\r\nSSF provides a diverse and engaging programme of weekly [professional studies training](http://www.ssfscitt.org.uk/page/?title=Weekly+Professional+Studies&pid=16), covering the range of primary curriculum subjects, SEND, behaviour management, EAL and others. Training is led by a team of local and national experts and outstanding primary practitioners. Each year the training has a 100% good or very good rating, but is constantly reviewed and updated to keep pace with the changing primary school landscape and national priorities.\\r\n\\r\nWe recognise that location is an important factor for you so we run training in geographical cohorts and build local support networks (2019 hubs are Farnham, Reigate and Cobham).  \\r\n\\r\nConsideration of trainee workload underpins programme design and structure.  Personalised training plans ensure a steady pace and deadlines are carefully scheduled and do not overlap. Every trainee is allocated a school mentor and external support tutor to ensure that training is tailored to individual needs.\\r\n\\r\nAssessment is continuous and will include observations of your teaching, school based tasks and the ability to articulate your practice.

Whilst this is not a requirement of our selection procedures we would strongly advise candidates to seek potential links with local schools.\\r\n\\r\nThere are opportunities to experience two schools, visit a special educational needs school and to look at secondary, early years and EAL provision (pupils with English as an additional language)\\r\n\\r\nWe always welcome the opportunity to speak to head-teachers and senior leaders about becoming involved, particularly where a potential candidate is being supported by a school not currently in the partnership.\\r\n"
