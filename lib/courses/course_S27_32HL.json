    "AboutCourse": "The Southampton University Led Secondary M level PGCE course provides an excellent route into teaching. The course has consistently been rated highly by former trainees, and has been successful in a series of recent Ofsted inspections. Our PGCE Secondary programme is designed and taught jointly by the Southampton Education School (SEdS) in partnership with over 125 schools across the region in seven different subject areas, and has a very good track record of moving successful trainees into employment, locally and beyond. Two thirds of the PGCE is spent in two school placements, starting in October, under the guidance of curriculum mentors who are all experienced classroom teachers. One third is spent in university, under the guidance of curriculum tutors, who all have extensive school teaching experience.\\r\nOverview of the PGCE Secondary Art and design course\\r\nOur PGCE Secondary course will equip you with the necessary skills and knowledge to teach Art & Design across the 11-16 age range, including some opportunities to know more about 16-19 teaching. The course is designed to develop teachers that have a clear and well-founded understanding of their subject and how to teach it. We aim for reflective and dynamic practitioners willing to use a variety of teaching strategies to inspire all students. You will gain a clear understanding of the nature and process of learning Art & Design and the impact of this on classroom teaching and learning. This will supports you to develop strategies to overcome challenges and ensure pupils make progress whilst fostering a passion for the subject. \\r\nThe course leader works in close partnership with local schools to develop your subject and pedagogical knowledge though a variety of engaging approaches including interactive teaching, group discussions, micro-teaching and independent and collaborative exploration of secondary school art and design.\\r\nThe PGCE Secondary art and design course\\r\n(https://www.southampton.ac.uk/education/postgraduate/itt_courses/pgce-art-and-design.page)\\r\n",
    "CourseLength": "OneYear",

The normal expectation is that students will have at least 50% of their first degree in their chosen subject. Minimum degree required: 2:2.\\r\nCurrently, you must have GCSE passes at grade C/grade 4 or above in English Language and Mathematics. This is a government requirement, and ‘equivalent qualifications' are as designated by the PGCE admissions team (IELTS qualifications are not considered equivalent). If your qualifications are not considered to be appropriate, we can offer GCSE equivalent tests in English and Maths.\\r\n",
    "FeeInternational": 18104.0,
    "InterviewProcess": "At interview, candidates will meet the tutor team and learn about key elements of the programme, including how trainees are supported and developed, how placements work and how trainees are assessed. Each candidate will give a short presentation related to their curriculum subject and will complete a written task followed by an individual interview with subject tutors.",
    "OtherRequirements": "You will be required to obtain:\\r\n* complete a form describing your state of health which will be checked against the DfE Fitness to Teach regulations \\r\n* to provide an Enhanced Disclosure from the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) to confirm that there are no criminal offences on your record which should bar you from teaching.

    "HowSchoolPlacementsWork": "Each trainee undertakes two block placements in schools within our Partnership. We aim to provide schools that offer contrasting placement experiences in order to develop a breadth and range of skills. During the placement blocks, one day per week is dedicated to training with the university in either curriculum or professional development. A regular programme of school based professional training is also delivered whilst trainees are on placement. Whilst on placement, each trainee is allocated a mentor from their subject area and a professional mentor to oversee the professional training. Trainees will also receive visits from their university tutor to support them in their teaching and professional development."

    "TrainWithUs": "Our Initial Teacher Education department is a dynamic and thriving community of professional educators and researchers. In AY2017-2018 Southampton Education School was ranked 2nd in the Guardian University League Table.\\r\n\\r\nWhy come to Southampton?\\r\n\\r\n* Our Tutors. In every forum the dedication and commitment of our Tutors is praised. Trainee Teachers rate them extremely highly, External Examiners praise the time and effort that Tutors devote to Trainees and Ofsted recognises the ‘high quality mentoring and support’ offered. \\r\n* Our quality of teaching and our diverse partnerships and placements. Our Tutors are all Teachers. We thrive through continuous professional development – and very much enjoy implementing new research or theories in partnership with Trainee Teachers and the Schools that we work with. Our Partner Schools are key to our success, and the Mentors that we work are experienced, dedicated and enthusiastic. \\r\n* Our commitment to Health and Wellbeing. The health and wellbeing of our Trainee Teachers, and the students that they teach, is central to producing outstanding teachers and happy students who can make progress and succeed.\\r\n* Our scope to personalise and individualise your learning on your Programme. Every Trainee Teacher is unique, and we want each and every trainee to be the very best teacher that they can be. We achieve this by personalising our programmes to suit you.\\r\n* Our commitment to ‘Student Voice’. We actively encourage trainees to work with us to make our courses even better. \\r\n* Employability. Almost 100% of our Trainee Teachers get jobs. \\r\n",
    "TrainWithDisability": "At Southampton we welcome applications from candidates with disabilities and other needs. SEND is a very important element of our training throughout the PGCE, and trainees who have personal experiences of SEND are of real benefit to our programmes, as they bring a wealth of experience.\\r\n\\r\nHow are Trainee Teachers with disabilities and other needs supported?\\r\n\\r\n* Trainees with dyslexia meet together at the start of the course for an informal session, led by a tutor with significant SEND experience. This group is then enabled to support one another throughout the course, with individual, personalised, input from the tutor as required.\\r\n* Trainees with Physical Disabilities are always accommodated as appropriate and a wide variety of modifications are available.  For example, a student with a hearing impairment may be supported by our enabling services, as well as by their Personal Academic Tutor with services such as remote transcription available - we work with individuals to ensure that their needs are met both when in University and when teaching in schools.\\r\n* We recognise that teaching can be stressful. The University offers a variety of services for Trainees who may be suffering from anxiety or depression, for example trainees can access talking therapies via the University Enabling Services. Trainees are also encouraged to make full use of their Personal Academic Tutor.\\r\n* The course team are able to personalise many aspects of the programme, to accommodate need on an individual basis, to enable successful completion of the course.\\r\n",
