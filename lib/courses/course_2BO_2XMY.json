    "Qualifications": "Minimum academic requirements to apply for a Primary PGCE are:\\r\n* 2.ii degree or above\\r\n* GCSE or equivalent qualifications in English, Mathematics and Science at grade C or above.\\r\n\\r\nSome experience of working with children/young people and the ability to work as part of a team would be beneficial. While you do not have to have any experience in schools, we strongly recommend you have experience of teaching before applying, for your own benefit.\\r\n",
    "InterviewProcess": "We carefully consider all the applications we receive, in conjunction with the Admissions team at Bath Spa University. If you are invited to interview we will notify you by email and on UCAS. You will normally need to allow up to 3 hours at one of our partner Primary schools for your interview.\\r\n\\r\nThe interview process includes a short observed teaching task with a group of pupils, usually from Year 5 or 6, a written task, and a formal interview. You will be told in advance about the content of the teaching task and the age group you will be teaching, as well as any other relevant information to enable you to demonstrate your skills and qualities.\\r\nYou will need to bring your original exam certificates with you to be checked, as well as some personal identification. This would be checked and passed to Bath Spa University only if we intend to offer you a place on the course.\\r\n\\r\nFollowing your interview we will aim to notify you of the outcome on UCAS within 2 working days. Offers may be conditional on passing skills tests or completing a degree or other qualification.\\r\n\\r\nIf you are offered a place and choose to accept it, we will then contact you with further information about the course.",

    "PersonalQualities": "Our aim is to train you to embrace the professional qualities and attributes necessary to be an outstanding teacher, and to maximise the outcomes of the children and young people you teach.\\r\n\\r\nBecoming a teacher is very much about being a team member and this will be reflected over the tenure of your programme. You will need to work effectively on joint projects, work collaboratively as a member of a team, and going forward in your career, accept leadership roles. You will need excellent communication skills and the ability to remain professional at all times, without exception. ",

Many of our students have family or childcare commitments and we aim to place them in schools that mean travelling time will be kept to a minimum.\\r\n\\r\nYou will have two placements. In each school you will have a designated mentor and you will be in regular contact with Excalibur Teaching School through weekly professional studies sessions and meetings with our Professional Tutor.\\r\n\\r\nOver the course of the two placements you will have the opportunity to work in both Key Stage One and Key Stage Two. \\r\n\\r\nDuring your placements you will be able to watch experienced teachers in action and teach classes, from initially taking the register, then team teaching short sections of the lesson and gradually moving on to teaching the whole class. By the Summer Term you will be teaching most of the timetable in your class. \\r\n\\r\nYou will work alongside experienced teachers to complete tasks that are designed to offer practical learning through first-hand experience in the classroom. \\r\n\\r\nYou will be fully integrated into your placement school providing you with opportunities to experience the wider day to day running of a primary school with an experienced mentor to guide and support you."
