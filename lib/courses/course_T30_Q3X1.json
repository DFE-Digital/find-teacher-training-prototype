    "AboutCourse": "Course introduction\\r\nThe University of Portsmouth's PGCE Initial Teacher Training Secondary in English is a one-year, full-time course for graduates who wish to train as secondary school English teachers. It is run by the University's School of Education and Continuing Studies and offers the choice of following either the Professional Graduate Certificate in Education route (taking all modules at higher education level) or the Postgraduate Certificate in Education (with 60 credits towards a Master's degree). \\r\n\\r\nEnglish is a core subject of the secondary curriculum at Key Stage 3 and 4. English is an engaging and constantly evolving subject in the school curriculum. On the PGCE course you will learn not only about issues related to English teaching, but also about developing an understanding of educational issues pertaining to teaching and learning, classroom interaction, the school curriculum and the school and society. As well as learning to become a competent classroom practitioner, you will learn to make important decisions and recognise the need for reflection and evaluation. \\r\n\\r\nCourse aims\\r\nThe course is designed to enable you to become a capable and confident teacher at secondary level. Abilities to teach the National Curriculum and encourage learning will be developed alongside the skills and understanding required of effective teachers by the Teachers' Standards. \\r\n\\r\nMode of study\\r\nThis is a one-year full-time course (36 weeks). \\r\n\\r\nCourse outline\\r\nThe English course integrates theory with practice and two-thirds of your time will be spent in a school, where you will be working closely with mentors and other school staff. \\r\n\\r\nThroughout the year you will be engaged in considering a range of subjects including: \\r\n\\r\n*subject knowledge enhancement\\r\n*ICT in the classroom\\r\n*lesson planning\\r\n*classroom management\\r\n*special needs and inclusion\\r\n*assessment\\r\n*creative learning\\r\n\\r\nThe University works closely in partnership with a number of schools. Two thirds of your time is spent in schools, where you will receive the support of school-based mentors required of the school's teaching staff. You will spend an increasing amount of time in school as the course progresses, beginning in Term One with three days per week. In Term Two, four days a week will be spent in school and in Term Three, five days a week. The emphasis throughout will be on helping you to gain progressively more confidence and competence in order to attain an increasing level of responsibility in the classroom. ",
