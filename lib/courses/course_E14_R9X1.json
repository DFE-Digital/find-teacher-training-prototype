    "AboutCourse": "The programme is designed for those intending to teach French, German or Spanish as their subject specialism; all students must be able to offer French as at least their second language. The aim is to give you an understanding of the way modern foreign languages are taught in schools, including the use of the target language as the principal means of classroom communication. \\r\n\\r\n\\r\nYou will be encouraged to try out a wide range of approaches to teaching, as well as strategies for organising the classroom for effective learning. University sessions include a large amount of practically based activities to help you develop your skills. You will have the opportunity to acquire an understanding of the demands of the National Curriculum orders for modern foreign languages. The work in schools will be closely linked with the university-based sessions so that you will have the opportunity to use a range of up-to-date language resources, including ICT, to set up active and engaging learning activities. \\r\n\\r\nFor more information please visit our website here. \\r\n(https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/postgraduate-courses/pgce-secondary/pgce-secondary-modern-foreign-languages-specialism/)\\r\n",
    "CourseLength": "OneYear",
    "Qualifications": "Applicants should have a degree with French, German or Spanish as a major component. The ability to offer a second language is essential. We welcome applications from native speakers who have a degree in another subject.\\r\n\\r\nStudents must have achieved at least a grade C or above in both Mathematics and English Language GCSEs (or approved equivalents), applicants without one or both of these GCSEs (or approved equivalents) will be considered for interview. If you do not currently hold a GCSE grade C or above in Mathematics and English Language, we accept the equivalency tests offered by Equivalency Testing.\\r\n",
    "InterviewProcess": "On the interview day you will be registered by a member of the admissions team. There will then be a course talk and an introduction to the subject tutors. There will be a group interview, this is a discussion based on what you have learned from your observations in school and teaching in general. \\r\n\\r\nFollowing the group task will be individual interviews with the subject tutor lasting 20-45 minutes you will have an opportunity to ask questions about the course during the interview. You may be asked to discuss a portfolio where relevant, or to give a presentation. \\r\n\\r\nThere will also be a written task, where you will be asked to write a short piece on the role of your subject within the national curriculum. This is to check your Spelling, Punctuation and Grammar, and to see what your response would be to writing at Masterâ€™s level.\\r\n\\r\nThese interview elements are not intimidating, but carefully planned to give you the best possible opportunity to show your potential for teaching and working with young people in school. A teacher from one of our partner schools may take part in the interview.",
