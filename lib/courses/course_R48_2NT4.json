    "AboutCourse": "The key aim of this programme is to enable students to become confident, knowledgeable and enthusiastic teachers of art and design. The programme provides opportunities for students to explore the theory and practice of art and design education through a range of lectures, workshops and tutorials, and to develop their expertise in the classroom through two school placements. \\r\n\\r\nThe course will provide students with an awareness of the theoretical foundations of the subject, of strategies for teaching and learning in art and design and of current issues surrounding art and design education. Workshops will enable students to explore a range of practical processes including drawing, painting, printmaking, sculpture, textiles, photography and digital art. Regular tutorials enable students to receive individual support from tutors. Lecturers on the programme are experienced teachers of art and design and active researchers in the field of art and design education, while visiting artists offer workshops in specific processes.\\r\n\\r\nYour school experience and your university-based learning are assessed throughout the year. A detailed profile document is given to you early in the programme and is used to record your developing ability to meet the Professional Standards for the award of QTS. Completing the profile is a collaborative exercise involving you, your Roehampton subject tutor and your school mentor. The profile draws on a wide range of evidence, including university- and school-based activities, your school experience file and, of course, the teaching carried out in the classroom. \\r\n\\r\n\\r\nThe PGCE Secondary course is also assessed by means of three assignments. These are closely linked to your work in schools and are designed to encourage reflection on practical and theoretical perspectives underpinning effective and reflective teaching and learning. \\r\n\\r\nFor more information please visit our website here. \\r\n(https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/postgraduate-courses/pgce-secondary/pgce-art-and-design-specialism/)\\r\n",
    "CourseLength": "OneYear",
    "Qualifications": "Applicants should have a degree that includes a substantial element of art, craft or design (such as Fine Art, Graphics, Fashion or Textiles). \\r\n\\r\nStudents must have achieved at least a grade C or above in both Mathematics and English Language GCSEs (or approved equivalents), applicants without one or both of these GCSEs (or approved equivalents) will be considered for interview. If you do not currently hold a GCSE grade C or above in Mathematics and English Language, we accept the equivalency tests offered by Equivalency Testing.",
    "InterviewProcess": "On the interview day you will be registered by a member of the admissions team. There will then be a course talk and an introduction to the subject tutors. There will be a group interview, this is a discussion based on what you have learned from your observations in school and teaching in general. \\r\n\\r\nFollowing the group task will be individual interviews with the subject tutor lasting 20-45 minutes you will have an opportunity to ask questions about the course during the interview. You may be asked to discuss a portfolio where relevant, or to give a presentation. \\r\n\\r\nThere will also be a written task, where you will be asked to write a short piece on the role of your subject within the national curriculum. This is to check your Spelling, Punctuation and Grammar, and to see what your response would be to writing at Masterâ€™s level.\\r\n\\r\nThese interview elements are not intimidating, but carefully planned to give you the best possible opportunity to show your potential for teaching and working with young people in school. A teacher from one of our partner schools may take part in the interview.",
    "OtherRequirements": "Pre entry Professional Skills Test All students starting an Initial Teacher Training (ITT) course from September 2013 are required to pass the Professional Skills tests in literacy and numeracy before the start of the programme (www.education.gov.uk). ",
    "HowSchoolPlacementsWork": "During school placements, students benefit from working alongside experienced teachers of art and design. Students have opportunities to observe excellent teaching before experimenting with approaches to teaching and learning across the secondary age range, during which time they are supervised and supported by teachers and tutors.
