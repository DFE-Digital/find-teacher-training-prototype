    "AboutCourse": "The PGCE Secondary course is a full time, one year Initial Teacher Education qualification introducing you to the requirements for teaching to the 11 – 16 age range. Where appropriate, opportunities to experience post 16 provision will be available. It has been designed to enable trainees to demonstrate evidence of having met the Teachers’ Standards that lead to Qualified Teacher Status. All trainees undertaking the University-led PGCE route into teaching will work towards securing 60 Master’s level credits. This is an integral part of the programme. We strongly believe that innovative and effective teaching and learning is made possible through a teacher’s full engagement with research informed practice and underpinning theories of learning. This is fostered in two modules and developed through School Based Training. Trainees on the PGCE Secondary programme will be well supported in becoming critically reflective teachers capable of inspiring their pupils to learn, achieve and flourish.\\r\n\\r\nAt the University of Hertfordshire, trainees will be supported and taught by specialist tutors with excellent experience, knowledge and research informed expertise. Partnership schools provide opportunities for trainees to learn about pedagogical approaches relevant to their subject specialism and the professional responsibilities of all teachers.\\r\n\\r\nYou will have two School Based Training placements, where, with the support of a teacher mentor and a university subject tutor, you will develop your skills to become an excellent classroom teacher. Training to teach is exciting, rewarding and demanding. By the end of the course you will be well prepared for employment as a Newly Qualified Teacher (NQT).",

    "TrainWithUs": "The Bournemouth Poole & Dorset Teacher Training Partnership is a consortium of 16 secondary schools working in close partnership. Our partnership schools extend from Swanage in the west to Lymington on the edge of the New Forest in the east. The Lead School for the Partnership is Twynham School, located in the historic harbour town of Christchurch, an OFSTED  'Outstanding' school and national Teaching School.  The Partnership offers a full-time one-year course running from September-July. Successful completion of this course brings with it the award of QTS (Qualified Teacher Status) with a PGCE (Post-Graduate Certificate in Education) validated by the University of Winchester \\r\n\\r\nA distinctive feature of the BPD course is the focus on carefully staged and appropriately supervised practical classroom experience within two secondary schools, which is further supported by academic and professional study via central training. All partner schools have experience of Initial Teacher Training and a good record of pupil progress and achievement. \\r\n\\r\nCurrently the BPD Partnership offers SCITT training in the following subject areas: English, Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, MFL, Design & Technology, Geography, Computer Science, Music, Physical Education, Art & Design, Religious Education, History & Dance/Performance. \\r\n\\r\nIf you are looking for a training course which is grounded in practical classroom experience then the school-centred route is ideal for you.\\r\nOur trainees have a very high success rate in completion and moving onto employment,  with the majority of those gaining employment working in the local area where many gain rapid promotion.\\r\n\\r\n {Check out our website](www.bpdscitt.org.uk)",
    "TrainWithDisability": "There is access for people with disabilities, although not all schools offering placements are able to cater for people with disabilities in all subjects due to the architecture and layout of school departments. Please contact the Partnership Office if you wish to discuss this aspect further. ",
