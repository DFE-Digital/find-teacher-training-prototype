The course covers the age range 3 to 7 years although trainees also spend a short time in a Key Stage 2 class.\\r\n\\r\nTrainees are assigned a trained school based trainer within each school that they are placed. This person is responsible for supporting and guiding the trainee’s professional development and ensuring that they have the opportunities that they need within the school.\\r\n\\r\nA trainee’s progress is assessed through regular formal and informal monitoring of teaching and written work.\\r\n\\r\nTraining in school progresses from observing and working alongside an experienced teacher to taking full responsibility, firstly for groups, and later for the whole class during the academic year. The course will produce qualified teachers who are competent and reflective across Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2.",

    "PersonalQualities": "- Convey commitment and enthusiasm to teaching in the primary age range.\\r\n- Be able to clearly articulate appropriate reasons for wanting to teach primary children.\\r\n- High level of motivation and enthusiasm for teaching and learning.",
    "HowSchoolPlacementsWork": "We work with over 70 schools across the county. This usually enables us to place trainees within a 30 minute drive from home. \\r\n\\r\nTrainees on this course complete their Autumn term placement in a Foundation Stage class and their Spring term placement in a Key Stage 1 class in a different school. During the Summer term, trainees usually return to the same Foundation Stage class as they were placed in during the Autumn term. \\r\n\\r\nDuring Spring trainees can apply to take part in an enhanced placement. These take place in special schools, area resource bases, pupil referral units and nursery schools. Enhanced placements aim to extend a trainee’s experience in a particular area of interest or need. Applications are carefully considered by the Course Leaders. "
