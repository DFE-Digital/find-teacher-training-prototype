You will have specialist inputs on your chosen subject and also gain experience of issues in planning and teaching cross-curricular work within the Humanities. Your two school placements are in your specialist subjects.\\r\n\\r\nWe are committed to History being taught as a lively, thought provoking subject.\\r\n\\r\nPGCE Secondary History aims to:\\r\n•Model good practice for your work with pupils, with an emphasis on active, student-centred learning; \\r\n\\r\n•Help you develop varied, imaginative strategies for use in the classroom\\r\ndemonstrate how artefacts, original documents and photographs, drama, role play and re-enactment, oral and local history and fieldwork can be used to enhance pupils’ learning;\\r\n\\r\n•Develop your capacity to reflect on the nature of the key concepts of History in order to be able to teach them well; \\r\n\\r\n•Provide you with opportunities to develop collaboratively with other History specialist trainees\\r\n\\r\n•Develop your understanding of your professional role as one which contributes within a department and whole school communities. \\r\n\\r\nThe course for History will help you to understand various frameworks for teaching the subject. Alongside regulatory frameworks and curriculum requirements the course helps you to understand the relationship of the school subject to Schools and Society, school history’s clear links with History as an Academic Discipline and to wider issues such as Historical Identity and communities.\\r\n\\r\nThe History course develops your understanding and practice in teaching your subject in a highly practical and experiential way and uses research into a range of fields as well as research into the conceptual nature of learning history, adolescent understanding of and attitudes to the subject.\\r\n\\r\nContinuous assessment is used throughout the course and there are no examinations\\r\n\\r\nApplications are welcome from students with good/very good qualifications in their History qualifications at GCSE and AS/A level (or equivalent) and at honours degree level. Those students with joint or combined honours degrees in which History is a major subject are also welcome to apply. \\r\n\\r\nStudents with degrees in a range of academic backgrounds including Classical Studies, Law, International Relations and Government and Politics may also be considered, although post-graduate study in History would be desirable in these circumstances.  \\r\n\\r\nIn all cases applicants are required to have an A level History qualification and should be able to demonstrate a genuine interest in and enthusiasm for History at interview. \\r\n",

    "HowSchoolPlacementsWork": "You will undertake two secondary teaching placements in our Partnership Schools. Leicester is ideally placed to offer the opportunity to work in both inner city and rural environments, with learners from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds. We try to place students in contrasting schools to ensure you have a rich and varied experience in your initial training year and that you have the opportunity to teach across the 11-18 age range.\\r\n\\r\nThe placements are referred to as 'Phase A' and 'Phase B' placements.\\r\nPhase A.  In planning your placements, your subject tutor will try to balance the distance you are asked to travel with your individual needs and our knowledge of our wide range of school partners. \\r\n\\r\nPhase A\\r\nAfter induction you will spend about 8 weeks in your Phase A placement school.  You will build on existing experience and develop new skills with support from the school's Coordinator for Initial Teacher Education and a subject mentor who will oversee your professional development during the placement and liaise closely with your university tutor who will also support you. \\r\n\\r\nPhase B\\r\nDuring your second placement you will spend about 14 weeks in a different school, also supported by a mentor, ITE Coordinator and university tutor.
