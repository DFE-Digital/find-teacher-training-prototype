    "AboutCourse": "You will join your host school at the start of September and this will be your base for the coming year. As this is a School Direct course the majority of the time is spent in school, with the rest of the time on campus at our Accredited Provider, Newman University. There are two university-based days per week in two 5-week blocks at the beginning of the Autumn  and Spring terms. On campus, you will learn about the core curriculum (Maths, English and Science) and receive training for teaching PE from Primary PE experts. At Newman, your training  will examine the Primary curriculum in detail, looking at  subject knowledge necessary to teach Maths, English and Science, how to promote learning in the classroom and manage behaviour. Lesson planning is a key element of what you do and you will also learn how to plan and implement student assessments. You will link your theoretical knowledge to what you see happening in school and you will reflect on how this supports your own learning. \\r\n\\r\nFor school- based training we team up with other local Teaching School Alliances to provide you with an insight into the broader curriculum. You visit different schools where local experts will instruct you in Phonics teaching, or Modern Language or Design and Technology. This seminar-style teaching is followed up by tasks which you carry out in your base school to demonstrate your understanding of the subject.  \\r\n\\r\nCourse Assessment includes practical elements, so you will get regular feedback on your teaching, as well as some formal observations. You will monitor your own progress through  subject audits, an online reflective journal and evidence files. Academic progress is assessed through two Masters level essays. \\r\n\\r\nOur accredited provider has a strong reputation for teacher training: \\r\n'Trainees’ attainment is high, especially through the School Direct route, where around three quarters of trainees were judged outstanding’ \\r\n (Ofsted Report, December 2015). \\r\n\\r\nWe welcome applications from candidates from abroad, although you must demonstrate sufficient spoken and written English proficiency to meet the demands of the course and to communicate with children in class and colleagues in school.\\r\n\\r\nThe Primary School Direct Course with the St Francis Xavier Teaching School is designed to give you opportunity to cover all aspects of the primary curriculum where possible, so that you have a range of experiences to support your future employment.
