    "AboutCourse": "You will join your host school at the start of September and this will be your base for the coming year. As this is a School Direct course the majority of the time is spent in school, with the rest of the time on campus at our Accredited Provider, Newman University. There are two university-based days per week  in 4-week blocks at the beginning of the Autumn and Spring terms. In addition, fortnightly Friday refection and study days in the first term support you with time to consider practice and academic writing. There are occasional days back in University during the year.\\r\n\\r\nYou will receive training in how best to deliver the curriculum in French, which will include subject knowledge, how to build pupils' language learning skills, how to promote learning in the classroom and manage behaviour. Lesson planning is a key element of what you do and you will also learn how to plan and implement student assessments. You will link your theoretical knowledge to what you see happening in school and you will reflect on how this supports your own learning. \\r\n\\r\nCourse Assessment includes practical elements, so you will get regular feedback on your teaching, as well as some formal observations. You will monitor your own progress through an online reflective journal and evidence files. Academic progress is assessed through two Masters level essays. \\r\n\\r\nOur accredited provider has a strong reputation for teacher training: \\r\n'Trainees’ attainment is high, especially through the School Direct route, where around three quarters of trainees were judged outstanding’ \\r\n (Ofsted Report, December 2015). \\r\n\\r\nWe welcome applications from candidates who are native speakers of French, although you must demonstrate sufficient spoken and written English proficiency to meet the demands of the course and to communicate with children in class and colleagues in school.\\r\n\\r\nIf you have not spoken French in a while or French is perhaps your third language, you can enrol on a Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) course to supplement or update your Subject Knowledge. If taking a SKE course through our accredited provider, Newman University, the course will run on your University days and is therefore compatible with a School Direct course. On-line courses are also available. \\r\n\\r\nWe encourage trainees to be multi-lingual, so we recommend taking the opportunity to teach other languages you know as this updates your knowledge and is a potential asset  when you seek future employment. ",
    "CourseLength": "OneYear",
    "Qualifications": "You will require a good degree in French, or partly in French, for example International Business with French. You should normally have a second class honours degree or above and your chosen subject should normally represent 50% of your degree. \\r\n\\r\nIf you have overseas qualifications, check your qualifications with NARIC first, then contact the Teaching School to discuss equivalencies. The European CEFR qualification, French Level C1, may also be considered, provided you have a qualifying honours degree in another subject.\\r\n\\r\nIn addition, you should normally have a good A level in French or the overseas equivalent. \\r\n\\r\n",
    "OtherRequirements": "You will need to undertake criminal record checks: an Enhanced Disclosure Check is required for entry to Initial Teacher Training. You must be able to provide a current DBS certificate before you start a School Direct course with the St Francis Xavier Teaching School.",
